The Molecular Diagnostic templates include recommendations for laboratories and commercial manufacturers who may use the templates to help facilitate the preparation and submission of requests for emergency use authorizations (EUAs). The updates are regarding diagnostic tests for use with sample pooling, at the point of care, and in the detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens such as viruses that cause influenza.Today, the FDA posted a new template for commercial manufacturers to help facilitate the preparation and submission of emergency use authorization (EUA) requests for prescription or non-prescription COVID-19 diagnostic tests that can be performed entirely outside of a laboratory, such as at home, in schools or in other non-lab settings.Testing updates:To date, the FDA has currently authorized 193 tests under EUAs; these include 158 molecular tests, 33 antibody tests, and 2 antigen tests.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.###InquiriesMedia: Lee Herring 240-402-6386          Consumer: 888-INFO-FDARelated InformationRelated InformationFAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised)Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)Content current as of:07/29/2020Health Topic(s)CoronavirusFollow FDA Follow @US_FDA on Twitter Follow FDA on Facebook  Follow @FDAmedia on Twitter   More Press Announcements                                        Press Announcements                       Footer LinksFDA ArchiveAbout FDAAccessibilityVisitor Information Website Policies / PrivacyNo FEAR ActFOIAHHS.govUSA.govContact FDAFollow FDA on FacebookFollow FDA on TwitterView FDA videos on YouTubeSubscribe to FDA RSS feedsFDA Homepage Contact Number      1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)    Back to Top","Wed, 29 Jul 2020 21:45:00 GMT"

Ben Solomon            An Olympian-turned-scientist helped a $1 million basketball tournament tip off amid COVID-19  By Eli CahanJul. 30, 2020 , 8:00 AMScience’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Heising-Simons Foundation.It may not be as fraught as the debate over reopening schools, but trying to reboot sports of any type during a pandemic also presents a heady challenge. In Europe, where the coronavirus has mostly subsided, resuming professional sports has been relatively straightforward: Several major professional soccer leagues, including the Bundesliga and the Premier League, have wrapped up seasons with few incidents. But in countries such as the United States, where COVID-19 remains ubiquitous, restarting massive professional sports leagues has been an uphill battle.Take Major League Baseball’s (MLB’s) faltering start last week to its abbreviated season. Hours before the league’s first game, one of the star players on the reigning world champion Washington Nationals tested positive for COVID-19 and was pulled from the lineup. Less than 1 week later, MLB games are already being canceled or postponed. On the Miami Marlins, almost half of the players have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Related‘Vaccine nationalism’ threatens global plan to distribute COVID-19 shots fairlyTrump ‘owes us an apology.’ Chinese scientist at the center of COVID-19 origin theories speaks outClinical trials rebound after COVID-19 crash, but can enrollment gains continue?See all of our coverage of the coronavirus outbreakOther U.S.-based leagues in the early stages of their restarts are taking more cautious approaches. Though most of its 31 teams are based in the United States, the National Hockey League has sent all of them to play in one of two cities in Canada, where community spread of COVID-19 is dramatically lower. Meanwhile, 1600 kilometers south in COVID-19–ravaged Florida, the National Basketball Association (NBA) plans to restart its season this weekend inside what it hopes is a protective “bubble” at Walt Disney Resorts.The sport bubble strategy can work, at least to an extent. The National Women’s Soccer League, which set up an isolated campus in suburban Utah, completed an eight-team tournament, although one team was forced to withdraw because it had infected players. Major League Soccer, which also set up at Disney World in Florida, has gotten through about half of its own tournament; two of 24 teams so far have dropped out after players tested positive for the virus.Perhaps the biggest U.S. success story thus far comes from a relatively little-known contest called The Basketball Tournament (TBT), which awarded a $1 million prize to the winner of this year’s 24-team competition. In early July, TBT navigated through the pandemic—despite several positive coronavirus tests in players and staff before and during the competition—thanks to planning help from a former Olympic swimmer–turned–public health expert, Tara Kirk Sell of Johns Hopkins University.Sell, who specializes in trying to reduce the health impacts of large-scale events such as disasters and terrorism, advised TBT—which has been running since 2014 and is perhaps the sport’s premier winners-take-all competition—on issues such as transportation, lodging, hygiene, and how to test players, coach, and staff for SARS-CoV-2. “I was excited by the idea of a collaboration between private organizations and public health that could help us all figure out what we can do, and how we can do it safely,” she says.“We had to get the little things right”The seeds of the partnership were planted in March, after NBA suspended its season when Rudy Gobert—the Utah Jazz’s rim-busting, 2-meter-tall, 115-kilogram center—tested positive for COVID-19. That news “immediately called our event into question, all of sports, and … life as we knew it into the question,” says Jon Mugar, CEO of TBT. At the same time, Mugar knew the competition’s importance to the hundreds of players who converged from across the country every year for a shot at the money, the bragging rights, and maybe even an NBA contract.To decipher how the teams could play safely, Mugar read “every article [he] could get his hands on” that spoke to the management of sports and other kinds of large-scale events during an infectious outbreak. After contacting more than 50 public health and biosecurity specialists, he was referred to Sell. They clicked immediately: “She was intimately in touch with the importance of sports in society and culture,” Mugar says. Tara Kirk Sell                    Larry Canner/Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security            From Sell’s standpoint, TBT could be in some respects described as a natural culmination of her professional life. She has always been “intrigued” by the emotional power sports hold to advance the public health. For members of certain minority communities, star athletes from similar backgrounds in MLB or NBA can be seen as both advocates and role models for the community’s safety. When NBA basketball star Steph Curry speaks on Instagram to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leader of the U.S. COVID-19 response, those who admire and trust the player might pay heed to the scientist more than they would in other circumstances.  Sports, in this way, must be considered as much a part of a national public health strategy as funding for vaccines, says Sell, whose doctoral thesis evaluated the “media and policy responses to … dreaded communicable diseases” such as Ebola. She feels a particular urgency to this end—because the “loss of trust, increased division, and outright confusion” surrounding COVID-19 has meant doubt in U.S. health authorities has been mounting since April.Competitions like TBT provide the “model environment” for discovering how interactions of humans in close quarters can be handled safely during the COVID-19 era, Sell says. Pulling off such events, which incrementally restore aspects of normal social life, are the best route to rebuilding trust in public health authorities, she suggests. But they are also high stakes: “No doubt, events like [TBT] have all the makings of superspreading opportunities,” she says. “We [had] to get the little things right.”Eighteen iterations later, a plan “to leave no stone unturned”In late April, through a series of teleconferences with the TBT staff, Sell “pounded into our heads that the devil was in every last detail,” Mugar says. The goal, he notes, was “to leave no stone unturned to derisk every touchpoint.”The foundation of the TBT plan was built on saliva tests meant to detect proteins associated with active infection of SARV-CoV-2: Players would take six over the course of the 11-day tournament. To ensure results would be accessible within 18 hours, TBT enlisted a Rutgers University–associated lab within driving distance, should inclement weather prevent flights. (Such saliva “antigen” tests are not as sensitive and accurate as tests looking for viral genes—but they are cheaper, faster, and if used regularly enough, some scientists say, they can still stop an outbreak quickly. TBT used viral genome assays on nasal swabs only to confirm positive saliva tests, and MLB is adopting a similar strategy.)In turn, clear hygiene protocols, including disinfecting objects such as benches, room keys, gym equipment, and water bottles, would reduce the risk of transmission from any one individual to another. Laundry would be handled centrally, signage defined how players should reduce the risk of transmission in shared spaces such as elevators and dining halls, and text message reminders to maintain precautions for hand washing and mask wearing would be constant.Sell and Mugar also designed a health monitoring questionnaire that players could complete on their smartphones twice daily, in the hopes of catching COVID-19 symptoms that developed in between saliva tests—or in case of false negative tests (which could inappropriately lead a player who was sick to be cleared). An incomplete questionnaire—or one that noted worrisome symptoms such as fever or shortness of breath—would constitute criteria for isolating a player. Finally, in the near-inevitability that players tested positive, the formation of self-contained cohorts within teams for transportation to and from playing facilities—as well as dining and other group activities—would facilitate contact tracing if and when required.Before it was finalized, the team churned through 18 iterations of the safety plan. Still, Mugar and Sell had their doubts. For much of the nearly 12-hour drive from his home in Boston to Columbus, Ohio, where TBT would take place, Mugar wondered whether they’d even get the first game in. “For this to work, every single person would have to buy in,” Sell says, “it would definitely take some sacrifices for the greater good.”Courtside seats to the grand experimentIn advance of TBT’s Independence Day tip-off, some 400 players, coaches, support staffers, trainers, and referees descended on Ohio from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. The early days were bumpy. The Ohio Department of Health nearly canceled the competition because of surging caseloads in the region. About 30 participants tested positive in the days leading up to the competition—including six related to a team outbreak after one player went out partying. Nine players tested positive within hours of being on-site and were rapidly quarantined. And even after games began, Mugar received a worried text from Los Angeles Clippers star Chris Paul. He was watching live on TV and expressed concern about players shaking hands after games. “A lot of people doubted we could pull it off,” Sell says. Even TBT had reservations—all participants signed waivers releasing the tournament of legal liability from any consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infections.As the games continued, additional challenges cropped up, “almost all of which entailed an email to [Sell],” Mugar says. In one case, storms delayed a plane scheduled to take two batches of saliva samples to the Rutgers lab. But thanks to Sell’s contingency planning, one batch was able to be analyzed at a local facility. And after those samples came back negative, TBT’s organizers used Sell’s modeling of infectious disease risks to determine that play could continue with minimal risk despite the other batch not yet having been analyzed. In another episode, after a player tested positive for the virus, Sell’s contact tracing procedures ensured that teammates who had shared an ice pack with him underwent additional screening. They eventually tested negative and the tournament went on. “With each passing day, we saw more and more of the scenarios that [Sell] anticipated come to light,” Mugar says, “and with each passing day, we felt safer because of it.”After the championship game—in which the Golden Eagles (a group of Marquette University alumni) defeated Sideline Cancer (a group playing for a pancreatic cancer charity) 78 to 73—every TBT player, staffer, referee, and member of the press tested negative on their exit exam. Ohio’s governor, Michael DeWine (R), called the tournament “another step forward in our state’s efforts to responsibly restart Ohio.” Sell, who only watched a bit of the action on TV from her home in Baltimore, called the achievement “a combination of good planning, dedicated preparation, precise execution—and luck.”She hopes the procedures adopted by TBT can help beyond sports, too. Symptom self-monitoring, hygiene procedures, routine testing, and strategies for cohort contact tracing have all been applied in countries such as Taiwan, Singapore, and Japan that have, for now, safely reopened their economies. “Things are not going to be 100% normal for a [while],” Sell says, “I don’t think we can afford overlooking … the tiniest details.” Posted in: HealthScientific CommunityCoronavirusdoi:10.1126/science.abe0807Eli CahanEli Cahan is an intern on the News staff of Science.

Hahn, M.D. “The recommendations provided today are intended to help get tests to market that are simple enough to use at home, similar to a pregnancy test. We hope that with the innovation we’ve seen in test development, we could see tests that you could buy at a drug store, swab your nose or collect saliva, run the test, and receive results within minutes at home, once these tests become available. These types of tests will be a game changer in our fight against COVID-19 and will be crucial as the nation looks toward reopening.”The template includes recommendations for validation when a sample is to be collected and analyzed, and results are to be returned without the need to send a sample to a lab for analysis. The template also gives recommendations for validation of tests that are intended to be made available over-the-counter, that is, without a prescription.This template outlines the recommended performance for this type of test, including sensitivity and specificity. While the recommended sensitivity for these non-lab tests is lower than lab-based tests, the tremendous benefits of broader access to simple and fast testing options generally outweighs this risk.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

GALLAGHERA new study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases suggests that people with travel links to China, Iran, and Italy accounted for nearly two-thirds of initial COVID-19 cases in affected countries.Data on the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 are limited and the global epidemiology of confirmed cases outside of mainland China will likely be a point of scientific inquiry for some time due to complex transmission dynamics.Investigators publishing in The Lancet sought to move this area of epidemiological research forward by compiling information in publicly available reports from the pre-pandemic period leading up to March 10, 2020.Reports were gathered via public health agency websites, transcripts of press conferences, and social media feeds of government agencies.Travel history, exposures to other cases, and case characteristics were noted.In each of 99 affected countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76%) had recent travel to affected countries. According to investigators, 60 (61%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran.Among 1200 cases examined with age or sex information available, 874 (73%) were early cases. Early cases were defined as within the first 100 a country records.Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51 years (IQR 35–63); 25 (3%) of 762 early cases occurred in children younger than 18 years.Additionally, 21 (2%) of these 1200 cases were among health care workers.Out of 101 clusters identified during the pre-pandemic period, the most commonly identified transmission setting was households (76 [75%]; mean 2·6 cases per cluster [range 2–7]).The second and third most common sources of an outbreak appeared to be in non-health-care occupational settings (14 [14%]; mean 4·3 cases per cluster [2–14]), and large scale community gatherings (11 [11%]; mean 14·2 cases per cluster [4–36]).The investigators point out that although close household contact was an overwhelmingly large source of early clusters, clusters in occupational or community settings tended to be large. This means the results should not be taken as an endorsement or rejection of particular outbreak control policies by the authors.To stay informed on the latest in infectious disease news and developments, please sign up for our weekly newsletter.Related Coverage                                            The COVID-19 Live Vaccine Tracker                                                                                    Read more >>                                                                                    Dual Anti-Viral/Anti-Inflammatory Drug Study Against COVID-19 Begins                                                                                    Read more >>                                                                                    Herman Cain Passes After 3-Week Coronavirus Battle                                                                                    Read more >>                                        FEATURED                                         HIV Cure Research Has Slowed, But Still Progresses                            Is there a cure?

Specifically, the FDA reissued the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR Test EUA to expand use of the test to anyone after the company provided scientific data showing the test’s ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a general, asymptomatic population. Additionally, the reissuance also includes authorization for LabCorp to test pooled samples containing up to five individual swab specimens collected under observation. In general, sample pooling allows for fewer tests to be conducted overall, conserving resources and potentially allowing more tests to be evaluated more quickly.The FDA continues to warn consumers and health care professionals not to use certain alcohol-based hand sanitizers due to the dangerous presence of methanol. The agency issued a warning earlier this month about an increasing number of adverse events, including blindness, cardiac effects, effects on the central nervous system, and hospitalizations and death, primarily reported to poison control centers and state departments of health. The agency continues to see these figures rise.The agency has also taken additional action to help prevent certain hand sanitizers from entering the United States by placing them on an import alert. The FDA is proactively working with manufacturers to recall products and is encouraging retailers to remove products from store shelves and online marketplaces. A warning letter has also been issued to Eskbiochem S.A. de C.V. regarding the distribution of products labeled as manufactured at its facilities with undeclared methanol, misleading claims — including incorrectly stating that FDA approved these products — and improper manufacturing practices.On July 24, the agency approved an abbreviated new drug application, or generic, for heparin sodium. The FDA continues to work to help patients suffering from COVID-19 by reviewing and approving generic medicines, such as anti-coagulants, used in the prevention and treatment of blood clotting.On July 24, FDA issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to two companies for serology-based tests for the qualitative detection and differentiation of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The tests are intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection. The companies that were each issued an EUA are:Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., for its BIOTIME SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Qualitative Test, andAccess Bio, Inc., for its CareStart COVID-19 IgM/IgG.• Testing updates:To date, the FDA has currently authorized 191 tests under EUAs; these include 156 molecular tests, 33 antibody tests, and 2 antigen tests.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.###InquiriesMedia: Lee Herring 240-402-6386          Consumer: 888-INFO-FDARelated InformationRelated InformationFAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised)Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)Content current as of:07/27/2020Regulated Product(s)DrugsMedical DevicesHealth Topic(s)Infectious DiseaseCoronavirusFollow FDA Follow @US_FDA on Twitter Follow FDA on Facebook  Follow @FDAmedia on Twitter   More Press Announcements                                        Press Announcements                       Footer LinksFDA ArchiveAbout FDAAccessibilityVisitor Information Website Policies / PrivacyNo FEAR ActFOIAHHS.govUSA.govContact FDAFollow FDA on FacebookFollow FDA on TwitterView FDA videos on YouTubeSubscribe to FDA RSS feedsFDA Homepage Contact Number      1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)    Back to Top","Mon, 27 Jul 2020 21:47:00 GMT"

NIAIDWhatTwo doses of an experimental vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  induced robust immune responses and rapidly controlled the coronavirus in the upper and lower airways of rhesus macaques exposed to SARS-CoV-2, report scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.  SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, was co-developed by scientists at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center and at Moderna, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts. The animal study results published online today in the New England Journal of Medicine complement recently reported interim results from an NIAID-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA-1273. The candidate mRNA-1273 vaccine is manufactured by Moderna.In this study, three groups of eight rhesus macaques received two injections of 10 or 100 micrograms (µg) of mRNA-1273 or a placebo. Injections were spaced 28 days apart. Vaccinated macaques produced high levels of neutralizing antibodies directed at the surface spike protein used by SARS-CoV-2 to attach to and enter cells. Notably, say the investigators, animals receiving the 10-µg or 100-µg dose vaccine candidate produced neutralizing antibodies in the blood at levels well above those found in people who recovered from COVID-19.The experimental vaccine also induced Th1 T-cell responses but not Th2 responses. Induction of Th2 responses has been associated with a phenomenon called vaccine-associated enhancement of respiratory disease (VAERD). Vaccine-induced Th1 responses have not been associated with VAERD for other respiratory diseases. In addition, the experimental vaccine induced T follicular helper T-cell responses that may have contributed to the robust antibody response.Four weeks after the second injection, all the macaques were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 via both the nose and the lungs. Remarkably, after two days, no replicating virus was detectable in the lungs of seven out of eight of the macaques in both vaccinated groups, while all eight placebo-injected animals continued to have replicating virus in the lung. Moreover, none of the eight macaques vaccinated with 100 µg of mRNA-1273 had detectable virus in their noses two days after virus exposure. This is the first time an experimental COVID-19 vaccine tested in nonhuman primates has been shown to produce such rapid viral control in the upper airway, the investigators note. A COVID-19 vaccine that reduces viral replication in the lungs would limit disease in the individual, while reducing shedding in the upper airway would potentially lessen transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently reduce the spread of disease, they add.

That kicked off the record-breaking rush to develop vaccines — the salve that experts say could ultimately quell the pandemic.The colossal impact of the coronavirus is motivating the speed, opening a spigot of funding and inspiring research teams around the world to join the hunt. But the astonishing pace of the progress is also a consequence of the virus itself: It is, scientifically speaking, an easier target for potential vaccines than other pathogens, and a prime candidate for cutting-edge vaccine platforms new to scientists’ toolkits.advertisement“Once we got the sequence, we pulled the trigger to ask how fast we could go,” said Barney Graham, the deputy director of the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center. “And because it was a coronavirus, we could get into a Phase 3 trial in six months instead of two years.”Of course, progress so far remains just that. The vaccines are now facing their real tests: the monthslong, Phase 3 trials that will demonstrate whether or not they protect people from the virus.advertisement“This is a huge experiment and no one knows how it’s going to turn out,” said James Le Duc, the director of the University of Texas Medical Branch’s Galveston National Laboratory.Support STAT:If you value our coronavirus coverage, please consider making a one-time contribution to support our journalism.Vaccines typically take years, if not decades, to reach people; the record now is four years for the mumps vaccine. Here’s what has propelled the Covid-19 endeavor to eclipse prior efforts so far.A familiar familyIt’s difficult to associate anything with this pandemic with good fortune, but the fact that the culprit was a coronavirus — one that was strikingly similar to others that had previously leapt from animals to people — meant scientists could quickly rejigger vaccine projects in the works for those. It was almost like swapping a blue Lego for a red one in their assemblies.Many of the teams pursuing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 (the scientific name of the new coronavirus) have previously worked on vaccines for the original SARS virus, which caused a 2003 outbreak that killed some 800 people, and MERS, which has caused 2,500 cases since it started spreading in 2012.NewslettersSign up for Daily RecapA roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.Please enter a valid email address.Privacy PolicyLeave this field empty if you're human:  The earlier projects had pointed to a component of the coronaviruses called the spike protein as a ripe target for a vaccine, which gave scientists a head start for crafting their candidates. Work on SARS also illuminated stumbling blocks in designing coronavirus vaccines that Covid-19 immunizations have so far avoided.“What really helped was the knowledge gained from the SARS-1 infection,” said Rama Rao Amara, an immunologist and vaccine researcher at Emory University. “SARS-2 is quite similar to SARS-1, especially in that spike protein. People could take a very educated guess that this is the protein that we need to be going after.”Cells containing the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, seen through a microscope. BEN STANSALL/AFP via Getty ImagesAn acute, not chronic infectionSARS-CoV-2 causes an acute disease, Covid-19. It’s an infection that most people will clear on their own, which means there’s a vanquishing immune response that a vaccine can aim to induce in order to protect people.That’s not true for something like HIV, a virus for which there is no vaccine despite decades of research. HIV causes a chronic infection and integrates itself into people’s genomes; there’s no natural immune response that eliminates the virus that a vaccine can mimic. HIV also mutates much faster than coronaviruses do, meaning it’s more difficult to rally a lasting defense.It’s possible, then, that a pathogen that’s harder to design a vaccine for than the coronavirus could ignite the next pandemic.“We were more prepared for a coronavirus than for any other family,” NIH’s Graham said. “To me, this is a wake-up call that we need to have a more systematic universal approach to developing vaccines and other countermeasures for virus families ahead of time.”Related:Listen: Coronavirus vaccine data, saving the U.S.’s pandemic response, and systemic racism in medicineCutting-edge approachesVaccines train the immune system to recognize a pathogen it hasn’t yet encountered.Normally, our immune system builds that memory by battling an infection, so that it can halt a virus in its tracks should it try to invade a second time. A vaccine acts like that first exposure, but without making people sick.With SARS-CoV-2, researchers are working with new ways of providing that first look, building vaccines on adaptable platforms engineered to easily pivot from pathogen to pathogen.Older strategies for developing vaccines, such as obtaining the virus and weakening or inactivating it, are lengthy processes. But the cutting-edge approaches require scientists only to know the virus’ genetic sequence. With that, they can string together the right pieces of code to synthesize vaccines.Related:School closures in spring linked to drastic decrease in Covid-19 cases and deathsThat’s allowed scientists to move with record speed. Less than 10 weeks after the Chinese scientists published the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, a team from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the biotech company Moderna had a candidate ready for a Phase 1 trial.The Moderna/NIAID vaccine was built with mRNA, a piece of genetic code containing the instructions for the coronavirus’ spike protein. The vaccine shuttles the mRNA into cells, which “read” those instructions and churn out the protein — providing the immune system with that first peek to the spike, like giving a hound a scent.A team from Pfizer and the German company BioNTech is also working on an mRNA vaccine, while a company called Inovio is pursuing a vaccine based on a different genetic material, DNA. Neither an mRNA nor a DNA vaccine has been approved before.Knowing the sequence of the coronavirus has also spurred other approaches. Some groups — including Johnson & Johnson, the Chinese firm CanSino, and a collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca — are attaching the gene for the spike protein to another, harmless virus that ferries it into cells. There, it gets expressed into the spike, allowing the immune system to mount its forces. Another company, Novavax, is producing versions of the spike from the gene and using them directly in its vaccine.Related:Better than the rest or behind the competition? Moderna’s future hinges on how its Covid-19 vaccine faresThe spike protein is a strategic choice. The proteins, which give SARS-CoV-2 the crown-like appearance that’s characteristic of coronaviruses, attach to receptors on people’s cells, allowing the virus to enter and replicate. By blocking spike proteins, then, vaccines could prevent infection. The spikes are also the “immunodominant” piece of the virus, meaning they elicit the strongest immune response. (Some vaccines are based on the whole spike, while some include select portions.)President Trump looks on during a tour of the National Institutes of Health’s Vaccine Research Center in March. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty ImagesResearchers are not only relying on advances in vaccine platforms. Innovations in basic genetics, immunology, and structural biology have also fueled the pace at which Covid-19 vaccines are moving. One way scientists have discovered so much about the spike protein, for example, is by applying methods honed over years to research the proteins on HIV.Money, money, moneyGetting a vaccine approved is not just a scientific expedition. It’s also about money.One reason vaccine development is so slow normally is because companies want to see candidates successfully pass through each sequence in the development process before sinking funding into the next phase.But that playbook doesn’t fly in a pandemic.“This is the biggest emergency we’ve had in our lifetime,” said Kawsar Talaat, a Johns Hopkins infectious disease physician and vaccine researcher. “Money is kind of no object. We don’t have time to wait.”To rally companies, funding agencies, including governments and foundations like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, are throwing millions — and in some cases, billions — into the hunt for vaccines. On Sunday, for example, Moderna said it had received $472 million from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, on top of the $483 million it got in April.Related:Boosting the promise — and reining in the peril — of Covid-19 preprintsThe money isn’t just to cover the research and trials; it’s also to get companies to start manufacturing their products — even though their vaccines might not prove to be effective. It’s a strategy called manufacturing “at risk,” and public health experts say it’s necessary to ensure that any authorized vaccine can be rolled out to as many people as quickly as possible.The U.S. government is also striking deals with companies to purchase their vaccines even before clinical trials are completed, including a $1.6 billion agreement with Novavax that includes 100 million doses and a $1.95 billion compact with Pfizer and BioNTech, also for 100 million doses.“The fact that industry is able to hedge their bets like this and to make these investments is because the government has put up the money,” said UTMB’s Le Duc, who formerly led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s viral diseases division. “The government has recognized that this is an incredibly important issue and we need to be going full blast knowing full well that not all these vaccines will work. Some are going to be duds, and will lose money.”Related:‘It’s like you injected adrenaline into them’: Facebook’s vaccine misinformation problem faces a new test with Covid-19Regulatory nimblenessIn-the-weeds regulatory decisions don’t get much public attention, but they are helping expedite clinical trials and the ultimate evaluation of how effective a vaccine is.Many of these lessons were first learned during the West African Ebola crisis, when regulators embraced a new dexterity in green-lighting vaccine trials and took a more proactive approach to communicating with companies about the efficacy thresholds products needed to meet. That’s continuing with Covid-19: the Food and Drug Administration, for example, has outlined that vaccines need to prevent infections or reduce the severity of Covid-19 in 50% of recipients to be approved.The Ebola crisis “really did give the regulators greater experience and more comfort with the idea that they could have greater flexibility than they normally would have,” said Mark Feinberg, the president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and a former executive at Merck Vaccines. “They could make decisions more quickly and really be true partners in the development process.”Textbook clinical trials include three increasingly large phases that establish how safe and effective a drug or vaccine is. But with the Covid-19 pandemic, some of the trials have been collapsed into Phase 1/2 or Phase 2/3 trials. It’s a wonky distinction, but it can shave weeks or months off the process by saving research teams from having to write new protocols or get additional clearances.Related:The first U.S. Covid-19 case was found in her district. A congresswoman reflects on the last six monthsThe speed of vaccine development can also have an adverse effect. Some people have questioned how such a fast-moving process can ensure safety and might abstain from a vaccine. An Associated Press poll in May found that Black and Latinx Americans, who have been disproportionately harmed by the pandemic and have a history of mistreatment by the medical field, are more skeptical about Covid-19 vaccines than white Americans — showing the importance of outreach campaigns that public health experts say are required to increase the uptake of immunizations.Others have raised suspicions that President Trump — whose vaccine initiative is dubbed Operation Warp Speed — might force an emergency authorization of a vaccine before the election, even if it hasn’t cleared efficacy and safety standards. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday raised the specter of politics interfering in the quest for a vaccine.Scientists and regulators are already stressing that safeguards aren’t being jettisoned. Public health experts say vaccine makers need to be transparent that while manufacturing and regulatory steps are being streamlined, safety checks aren’t being sacrificed.In a call with reporters Monday, NIH Director Francis Collins, whom former President Obama first tapped for the position, defended the integrity of the decisions regulators will make. “Nothing is being done here to compromise the safety” of Covid-19 vaccine trials, he said, “nor will we compromise on an ultimate conclusion about whether the vaccine is effective. Those issues are going to be tested in the most rigorous way.”Related:Covid-19 vaccines may cause mild side effects, experts say, stressing need for education, not alarmThe challenges aheadExactly what all this speed will translate into remains to be seen. The monthslong, final-stage clinical trials starting now will settle that.The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech candidates respectively launched Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 trials this week, and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is in a Phase 2/3 trial. Others are entering pivotal studies soon. These involve enrolling thousands of people, injecting half with the candidate and half with a placebo or control, and then comparing whether people who received the vaccine are less likely to be infected than their counterparts.A doctor injects a study volunteer with a Covid-19 vaccine candidate as part of a clinical trial. NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP via Getty ImagesSome vaccine candidates could very well fail — a normal part of the scientific pursuit, experts say. “I hope that doesn’t happen, but people need to accept when things don’t pan out the way they hope,” said Maria Elena Bottazzi, the co-director of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor.It’s also not clear yet what a vaccine “working” will look like. A Covid-19 vaccine might be like the flu vaccine — only preventing infections in some people, or staving off serious disease but still leaving people contagious.STAT Plus:Exclusive analysis of biopharma, health policy, and the life sciences.A vaccine that prevents even 50% of infections would be a massive lifeline. But experts worry there’s a disconnect between a public expecting vaccines to instantly reset their lives and what the first vaccines may actually allow. Successful vaccines will likely be restricted to frontline workers and vulnerable populations at first. It could take some time for enough vaccine to be made for everyone who wants a shot. Some vaccines might require two doses to confer protection.“It might not be some magic bullet that’s going to stop the pandemic in its tracks, and people need to be prepared for that possibility,” said Columbia University virologist Angela Rasmussen about the first vaccines that reach people. “I really hate the term vaccine race. Because that implies there’s going to be a medal ceremony, and the pandemic is over.”About the AuthorReprints Andrew JosephGeneral Assignment ReporterAndrew is a general assignment reporter.andrew.joseph@statnews.com@DrewQJoseph TagsCoronavirusglobal healthpublic healthresearchvaccines Leave a Comment Cancel replyName Please enter your name.Email Address Please enter a valid email address.Comment Please enter a comment.Notify me of followup comments via e-mail  Adam Beattie says: July 30, 2020 at 12:21 pmFor a “General Assignment Reporter”, that was an extremely well-written article on complicated subject matter.

Derek Montgomery for MPR News fileDevelopmentsFrom around the stateTop headlinesFrom MPR NewsCOVID-19Tracking cases in MinnesotaThis vital news coverage is made possible by membersDonate todayUpdated 11:30 a.m.Minnesota’s upswing in COVID-19 continued Thursday with 745 new confirmed cases, although a recent jump in hospitalizations for the disease has paused.The Health Department reported 298 people currently hospitalized for the disease with 141 in intensive care. Those key metrics dipped slightly from Wednesday. Still, officials are increasingly concerned about the overall direction of those numbers as new case count rise.The state also passed a milestone with officials reporting more than 1 million tests for the disease completed since the pandemic began.Overall, the numbers offered a familiar refrain. Cases continue to trend upward, partially explained by slowly rising testing volume; hospitalizations are slowly trending up; deaths are flat.Officials reported five more deaths, bringing the toll to 1,594 since the pandemic began. About 76 percent of those who’ve died had been living in long-term care or assisted living facilities, nearly all had underlying health problems.Of the 53,692 confirmed COVID-19 cases during the pandemic, about 88 percent of those infected have recovered to the point they no longer need to be isolated.The newest numbers come as Gov. Tim Walz readies a 2 p.m. announcement Thursday on his decision about how to handle public school this fall given the ongoing pandemic. All this week, public health leaders have been ratcheting up their concerns that Minnesota is back on the wrong path in its fight against COVID-19’s spread.With every decision Minnesotans make now about masking or not masking, socially distancing or not, “you are contributing to the solution, or to the crisis,” said Kris Ehresmann, the state’s infectious disease director. Health officials “cannot do this on our own,” Ehresmann said, adding that success depends on Minnesotans doing the “right thing” in their behavior. Given the massive outbreaks elsewhere in the United States, Minnesota does not want to be like “states that didn’t see the COVID train before it ran them over,” she warned.More than a ‘blip’Wednesday marked the first time in a month that total current hospitalizations rose above 300, the product of a weekslong upswing in new confirmed infections, coming a day after Minnesota saw one of its largest one-day increases in hospitalizations since the pandemic began. While hospitalizations still remain far lower now than at the late-May peak, officials have been bracing Minnesotans in recent days to expect a surge following the climb in new confirmed cases. That appears to be happening.“As we have feared, we are seeing our hospitalizations begin to increase, and I don’t think it’s just a blip,” Ehresmann said.She also noted 83 new cases in long-term care facilities, a jump from the prior day — but most of the new infections were found in health care workers at those facilities, not residents. That’s especially worrisome because it indicates people are bringing in the disease and exposing vulnerable people.Cases growing across age brackets, up northState health officials continue to worry about the recent spike of coronavirus cases in younger Minnesotans, including that those infected will inadvertently spread the virus to grandparents and other more vulnerable populations.Minnesotans in their 20s now make up the age group with the most confirmed cases in the pandemic, with more than 12,500. The median age of Minnesotans infected has been trending down in recent weeks and is now 36 years old. Investigators continue to see rising cases with bars and restaurants at their center and are examining outbreaks in 28 establishments, Ehresmann said.“Consider all the roles you play” in all daily interactions, she cautioned, noting that people who might not worry about themselves should worry about infecting vulnerable family members and coworkers.Regionally, newly reported cases have been driven recently by the Twin Cities and its suburbs, but it’s present in all parts of the state, including the north, which had largely avoided the outbreak until recently.New cases have also been rising in northern Minnesota. Cases in Beltrami County, home to Bemidji, have more than doubled in the past week and a half, from 53 to 122 on Friday. That jumped again to 180 as of Thursday.Ehresmann last week said the Beltrami case increase is tied to spread from athletic events and other public gatherings.The six Minnesota counties with the fastest-growing COVID-19 case numbers over the last few days are in the northern part of the state:Walz’s schools decision imminentWalz will announce a plan Thursday on bringing kids back into school buildings. The state Education Department has told school leaders to pretty much prepare for anything, including some combination of in-school and online instruction.“Nobody wants kids in school more than me,” and state officials have been working for months on how to do that safely, Walz, a former high school teacher, said recently.“We’re doing everything possible to get those kids back in those classrooms … to keep them there but also have some nimbleness” to move back to an online or hybrid model if cases start to climb, he said, adding: “This is gonna be a challenge.”The DFL governor has suggested in recent days that there won’t be a uniform order that will determine whether school buildings reopen. On KFGO radio Friday, Walz reinforced that local decisions are important and it'll be up to school leaders to implement safety guidelines.""It won't necessarily look the same everywhere,” he said earlier this week, “but the outcomes need to be the same — kids and staff safe in that learning environment.”On Tuesday night, Minneapolis Public Schools said it plans to start out the school year virtually. Officials say they’ll create a better distance learning experience for families than during the time schools closed buildings last spring, and that the decision on when to return to school will depend on how COVID-19 evolves.Separately on Wednesday, Walz announced plans to give away 4 million masks to businesses across the state for free to help comply with the mask mandate. Walz and Minnesota health officials say the state needs 90 percent or better compliance to curb the spread of the virus and eliminate the need to walk back business openings.Minnesota’s mask mandate took effect Saturday. State health officials said it would be several weeks before officials could assess its impact.Developments from around the stateMost fall classes at U of M likely to go onlineThe University of Minnesota will likely have a majority of its classes fully online this fall. The university on Wednesday rolled out plans that allow for flexibility in classes because of the COVID-19 pandemic.More than 6,200 classes are listed as online or remote. So far, the Twin Cities campus has around 2,600 classes assigned to a room — which means they'll be either in-person classes or used in a hybrid of in person and online.A spokesperson for the university said these numbers are not final. He said more than 60 percent of students who had planned to study on the Twin Cities campus have at least one in-person or blended format class on their schedule currently.Students are free to adjust their classes to take them in the format that works best for them.— Peter Cox | MPR NewsComo Zoo reopens — with some COVID-19 restrictionsSt. Paul’s Como Zoo reopened on Wednesday after being closed to visitors for months because of the coronavirus.The zoo is allowing up to 250 people at a time, with reserved entry at half-hour intervals. All staff and visitors are required to wear face masks. Reservations are limited to four people at a time. Visitors will move through the conservatory and zoo on a one-way walking path, although some buildings will be closed and the zoo will only be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.Como Zoo is the most recent major Twin Cities attraction to reopen. The Minnesota Zoo opened last week, and the Walker Art Center, the Bell Museum and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts opened earlier this month. The Minnesota Children's Museum will reopen Aug. 1 and the Science Museum of Minnesota is scheduled to reopen the first week of September.— Tim Nelson | MPR NewsTop headlinesMinnesota officials to announce fall school plans Thursday: Gov. Tim Walz has said his administration will give districts and charters guidance and then let them decide how best to implement it. The governor said he wants students to be able to return to in-person classes, but to do it safely. Meanwhile, district leaders say they’re hungering for specifics.Minneapolis students likely to start year remotely: Minneapolis Public School officials plan to resume full-time remote learning this fall, though they’ll wait for the governor’s announcement Thursday to finalize the plan. Officials plan to improve the distance learning experience, even as they intend to bring students back to buildings later in the school year.Mpls. limits bar service as people crowd too close together in some establishments: With COVID-19 cases on the rise in Minneapolis, Mayor Jacob Frey is imposing new restrictions on bars.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.JUST WATCHEDUS surpasses 150,000 coronavirus deathsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS surpasses 150,000 coronavirus deaths 02:22 (CNN)The rocky start to the baseball season is leaving some fans disappointed, with a number of games on hold because of a coronavirus outbreak on the Miami Marlins.After more than a dozen Miami Marlins players tested positive for the coronavirus, games scheduled in Miami and Philadelphia, where the Marlins last played, were postponed.While some may question the wisdom of holding games at all, even without fans in the stands, the lessons that sports leagues have learned so far about keeping players safe from the virus may be lessons for all of us.Shortened seasons and playing in ""bubbles"" to control the spread are some of the ways sports leagues have managed to keep playing during the pandemic.Staying at home and restricting who you interact withRead MoreThe National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association are keeping their players in a bubble -- an enclosed environment where participants live, practice and play all games, similar to a strategy of staying home and avoiding people outside your own bubble.So far, so good: During its two-week training camp that concluded Saturday, the NHL administered thousands of tests to its more than 800 players, the league said Monday. There were two positive tests the first week and none the second.Miami Marlins' season on hold after more players test positive for Covid-19""All 24 teams entered the secure zone in Edmonton and Toronto yesterday,"" the NHL said in a statement Monday. ""Each of the 52 members of the 24 teams (Players and Club staff) will be tested on a daily basis,"" the NHL said in a statement Monday.In the NBA, which has been keeping its players in a bubble at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, none of the 344 players tested since July 20 have tested positive for the coronavirus, the league and player's union said Wednesday.Only two players have tested positive since the bubble opened, and that was between July 7 and 13.The NBA restarts its 2019-2020 season Thursday at the resort near Orlando.And the leagues are taking the bubble strategy seriously. Two NBA players who inadvertently left the bubble -- Richaun Holmes of the Sacramento Kings and Bruno Caboclo of the Houston Rockets -- had to go back into quarantine, losing practice time.Outside of sports, a strict bubble may not be realistic for everyone -- but it's crucial to limit contact with others outside your home as much as possible by avoiding busy places such as bars or even family gatherings.In Maryland, contact tracers found 44% of people who tested positive for the virus had recently attended family gatherings, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Wednesday.Creating a pandemic social bubble: A how to guideThe tracers also found 23% of new Covid-19 cases had attended house parties and 21% had attended outdoor events, Hogan said at a news conference.""The fundamental things of avoiding crowds, physical separation, universal wearing of masks, closing the bars, hand hygiene -- those things matter and they can make a difference. So hopefully we'll appreciate that and do it in a very strict way,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday.Smaller is betterBubbles, though, aren't feasible for sports such as baseball because of the size of the teams, according to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.""We would have had to have multiple locations probably just in order to have enough facilities to make it work, the numbers of people involved and the numbers of people to support the number of players was much, much larger in our sport,"" Manfred told MLB Network. ""I think the NBA and the NHL have an advantage -- smaller numbers of players, shorter period of time,"" Manfred said. ""I understand why they did what they did. I'm just not sure it was workable for us.""The NBA and players' union say no players tested positive for the coronavirus, one day before the season restarts The close-up and contact nature of playing basketball makes the bubble all the more necessary.""When we were discussing what kinds of protocols would be for the best safety precautions for the baseball players, there were a certain set of things that were done. That's going to be a little bit different when you're talking about a much more contact sport,"" Fauci told CNN on Monday.Young and healthy people aren't necessarily immuneWith the number of young people driving the surge in Covid-19 cases in many areas of the country, another lesson from these sports players sticks out: The virus doesn't discriminate and is infecting even young, fit and healthy athletes.The Marlins example is also a reminder of how quickly and silently the virus spreads. Within days, the team went from few positive tests to 17, according to ESPN.And considering that the Miami team comes from one of the biggest Covid-19 hot spots in the country, it's a reminder that when traveling to or from a place where there's a large number of cases, following the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on self-isolating is a good idea.At a Massachusetts hospital recently, the coronavirus spread at a non-Covid-19 unit after an employee traveled to a hot spot and then went back to work, CNN affiliate WWLP reported.Testing is keyBubble or no, sports teams are illustrating the importance of testing. As the NHL said, it's testing every player, every day.The National Women's Soccer League was the first to return to play amid the pandemic, replacing their season at the end of June with a 30-day tournament instead of a regular schedule.Just before leaving to play in the tournament in Utah, six players and four staff members from the Orlando Pride tested positive for the virus. The team withdrew and the tournament went on, with no more cases reported. Without those tests, many more players and staff could have been infected. More than six months since the virus was discovered, much is still unknown. There's no cure and no vaccine. What is certain, health experts say, is that social distancing and wearing a mask offer the best protection for now.""We're not powerless,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield told ABC Tuesday. ""We have the most powerful weapon in our hands right now. I mean, it's an enormously powerful weapon. It's just a simple, flimsy mask.""""This virus can be defeated if people just wear a mask.""

One of her aides turned out to be her long-lost sister.    Doris Crippen with her long-lost sister, Bev Boro, after they were unexpectedly reunited at a rehabilitation center. (Daniel Johnson/Methodist Health System)By Sydney PageJuly 30, 2020 at 6:00 AM EDTIt was a regular day at the Nebraska rehabilitation center last month when Bev Boro, a medication aide, looked over her patient list. Suddenly, a name on the list stopped her cold: Doris Crippen.“I kept saying ‘Oh my God,’” said Boro, 53. “That must be her.”Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightShe had not seen her older sister in more than 50 years, though the two had long been searching for each other.The unlikely reunion was set in motion in May when Crippen, 73, was diagnosed with covid-19.She initially thought she had the flu and spent days in bed feeling exhausted and generally unwell, she said.“I just kept getting weaker and weaker,” Crippen said.One day while at her apartment in Omaha, she reached for a glass of water.AD“I fell right off the bed,” she said, adding that she was too weak to pick herself up off the ground.Crippen, who lives alone, lay helplessly on the floor for more than 24 hours before her son found her and rushed her to the hospital. An X-ray revealed that she had broken her arm. And she tested positive for covid-19.ADCrippen was hospitalized for more than a month at Nebraska Medicine, where she said she was not sure if she would survive.She did, and once she had recovered from the virus and tested negative, Crippen was sent to Dunklau Gardens — a rehabilitation center and nursing home in Fremont, Neb., associated with Methodist Fremont Health. Boro has worked there for more than two decades.ADNeither sister imagined they would find each other, let alone like this.Boro and Crippen share the same father but were born to different mothers. Their father had been married three times and had 10 children. Crippen is the oldest and Boro is the youngest.Crippen, who was 20 years old the last time she saw Boro, was raised by her mother and stepfather.When Boro was less than 6 months old, the state of Nebraska deemed her parents unfit to care for her and her three siblings, who subsequently entered the foster care system and were separately put up for adoption.Both women grew up in Nebraska and knew each other’s names. They spent years searching for each other, but never had any luck until now.ADAD“When I saw Doris’s name on the patient board, I was so nervous,” said Boro. “My heart was racing.”She knew Crippen was hard of hearing, so she brought a small dry-erase board with her. On it, in big bold letters, she wrote their father’s name, Wendall Huffman.Immediately, Crippen responded: “That’s my daddy.”“Then I pointed to myself and said, ‘He’s mine, too,’” explained Boro, who also cradled her arms back and forth in a rocking motion to indicate that she was her baby sister. “Then I showed her my badge with my name on it.” Crippen’s eyes filled with tears. “You have his eyes,” Crippen said, referring to their father, who has since died.The women, both shocked and delighted, sat speechless across from each other.AD“I never thought I’d find her,” said Crippen. “I couldn’t sleep that night; I was just so happy.”Amid the pandemic, a family learns their neighbors are their relatives they never knewDespite the suffering Crippen has endured since contracting covid-19, she said she considers the fall, her diagnosis and other covid-19 complications “a blessing” because it brought her to her family.“I am the happiest person in the world,” said Crippen. “I cannot believe I finally found my sister.”Since they met on June 27, the women have been spending time together regularly, sharing stories and making up for lost time. Over the years, Boro had connected with four of their siblings through Facebook and introduced them virtually to Crippen.ADWhile the women knew nothing about each other when they reunited, “we have a very deep connection,” said Boro. “This experience has changed my life.”ADThe sisters’ reunion has also brought much-needed hope and joy to the hospital staff during what has been a particularly dark period for health-care workers.“I tear up every time I hear the story,” said Jayma Brown, director of nursing at Dunklau Gardens. “In the height of the pandemic, it’s just an amazing story.”The sisters have already started planning a family reunion and are hoping to meet the other siblings from whom they were also separated more than half a century ago.Photographer brings American historical figures to life with portraits of their descendantsBoro, who has three children and five grandchildren, said she is most looking forward to introducing her sister to her family.“I can’t wait to meet my sister’s kids and grandkids,” said Crippen, who has three children and 16 grandchildren.ADADHer granddaughter, Samantha Crippen, 28, who had tried to help her grandmother locate her siblings, said she is thrilled with the news.“My mind is blown,” said Samantha, adding that she’s excited to connect with her new family members. “I couldn’t be happier for my grandmother. She deserves this.” Crippen’s daughter, Lisa Crippen, 47, agreed. “Mom has been praying to meet her siblings for so long,” she said.“It’s crazy how without covid-19, they never would have met,” added Boro’s son, Kevin Boro, 32. He has already connected with Crippen on Facebook, and the two have chatted with the hopes of meeting.Crippen’s path to finding Boro was fraught with pain.AD“But this here?” she said, clutching her sister’s hand, “this makes up for everything.”Read more: 94-year-old ‘Rosie the Riveter’ once made warplanes and red bandannas.

Health care workers should be first in line for pandemic vaccines, global health experts say.                    SIMON WOHLFAHRT/AFP/Getty Images            ‘Vaccine nationalism’ threatens global plan to distribute COVID-19 shots fairly  By Kai KupferschmidtJul. 28, 2020 , 5:50 PMScience’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Heising-Simons Foundation.As soon as the first COVID-19 vaccines get approved, a staggering global need will confront limited supplies. Many health experts say it’s clear who should get the first shots: health care workers around the world, then people at a higher risk of severe disease, then those in areas where the disease is spreading rapidly, and finally, the rest of us. Such a strategy “saves the most lives and slows transmission the fastest,” says Christopher Elias, who heads the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Development Division. “It would be ludicrous if low-risk people in rich countries get the vaccine when health care workers in South Africa don’t,” adds Ellen ‘t Hoen, a Dutch lawyer and public health activist.Yet money and national interest may win out. The United States and Europe are placing advance orders for hundreds of millions of doses of successful vaccines, potentially leaving little for poorer parts of the world. “I’m very concerned,” says John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.RelatedTrump ‘owes us an apology.’ Chinese scientist at the center of COVID-19 origin theories speaks outClinical trials rebound after COVID-19 crash, but can enrollment gains continue?The line is forming for a COVID-19 vaccine. Who should be at the front?See all of our coverage of the coronavirus outbreakTo avoid such a scenario, the World Health Organization and other international organizations have set up a system to accelerate and equitably distribute vaccines, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility, which seeks to entice rich countries to sign on by reducing their own risk that they’re betting on the wrong vaccine candidates. But the idea has been put together on the fly, and it’s unclear how many rich countries will join.Recent history isn’t encouraging. A cocktail of powerful antiviral drugs revolutionized HIV treatment in the West in 1996, saving many lives, but it took 7 years for the drugs to become widely available in Africa, the hardest hit continent. “That was catastrophic and that experience is high in my mind,” Nkengasong says. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the United States and many European countries donated 10% of their vaccine stocks to poorer countries—but only after it became clear they had enough for their own populations. “Too many had to wait too long for too little,” says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a partner in COVAX.This time, too, rich countries’ biggest concern is to protect their own citizens. The U.S. government has signed deals worth more than $6 billion with several vaccine companies as part of Operation Warp Speed, which aims to provide the U.S. population with vaccines by January 2021. Europe’s Inclusive Vaccines Alliance, formed by France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, has signed a deal to buy 400 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine for use in EU member states. The United Kingdom has inked deals with AstraZeneca and other companies as well. China is developing its own vaccines; it’s unclear how early it will be willing to share or whether the shots will come with political strings attached.The idea behind COVAX is to invest in about 12 different vaccines and ensure early access when they become available. “The goal is to have 2 billion doses by the end of 2021,” says Seth Berkley, director of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the third COVAX partner: 950 million for high- and upper middle-income countries, 950 million for low- and lower middle-income countries, and 100 million for “humanitarian situations and outbreaks that are out of control.” A first $750 million deal with AstraZeneca for 300 million doses was announced on 4 June.Berkley accepts that many rich countries will do their own deals with manufacturers. But signing up to COVAX in addition is an insurance policy, he says. If the vaccines they have invested in fail to materialize, they would still have access to others through COVAX, although only enough for 20% of their populations. The money they invest will be used to guarantee lower prices for poorer countries. Separately, the COVAX Advance Market Commitment is collecting donations from the higher-income countries. GAVI says COVAX will need $2 billion in donations to pay for the vaccine doses in 90 countries. “We’re trying to do everything we can to try to have a global approach because we think it’s the right thing to do from a science point of view and from an equity point of view,” Berkley says.COVAX is planning to spread its own risk by investing in a variety of vaccine strategies. Single-dose vaccines could be easier to give in refugee camps, for instance, whereas a double-dose regimen might work fine at a European doctor’s office. Some vaccines are based on new technology, creating more uncertainty about regulatory approval and manufacturing capacity. COVAX also hopes to source its vaccines from companies in different locations, so that no single country can stop them from being exported.COVAX is a clever way to try to hold together the interests of different countries, says David Fidler, an adjunct senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Even from the point of view of raw self-interest that governments often have, you can see why this would look attractive,” he says. “They’re not ignoring the political reality.” But he worries countries may hesitate to sign up, and that those that do may renege on the deal once the scramble for doses actually begins.So far, more than 70 countries that plan to finance their own vaccine have expressed interest in signing up with COVAX. (They have to formally commit by the end of August and provide an advance of 15% of the overall amount.) Whether they will come through is another matter. Some countries in the European Union—which often stresses the importance of global solidarity—have indicated they intend to donate money, but may not order vaccines themselves through COVAX. “Where the procurement of doses for themselves is concerned, we are still actively discussing with them,” Hatchett says. “There are models where we could work together.”Nkengasong says Africa needs to explore other avenues as well. “We welcome the COVAX Facility arrangement but we cannot just wait for discussions in Geneva,” he says. “We need to take charge of our own destiny.” At an African Union meeting in late June, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called on leaders to secure vaccine supplies for the continent and ensure that vaccines are manufactured there. Nkengasong says African governments are approaching banks to finance deals with pharma companies similar to those signed by the United States. “We need to come together as a continent of 1.3 billion people to not be left behind.”Kate Elder, a vaccines expert at Doctors Without Borders’s Access Campaign, sees COVAX as perhaps the best shot at an equitable distribution of vaccines, but says it should be more transparent. “How did they choose AstraZeneca? What conditions are there in the agreement with AstraZeneca if the company doesn’t meet volume commitments?” she asks. “None of the conditions around that are known.” Both COVAX and governments should also ensure that funded vaccine producers make their data freely available to any company that wants to use them, ‘t Hoen adds. “I’m very worried that they are doing this without strings attached, that the know-how that is developed with this public funding does not become publicly available for others to use,” she says.What’s needed most for COVAX to work is political commitment at the highest levels of government, says Alexandra Phelan, a lawyer at Georgetown University who specializes in global health. Without “a really big international effort,” for instance at the United Nations or the G-20, the early doses of vaccines are unlikely to go to those who need them most, Phelan says. “It will be slow, it will be inadequate, and there will be unnecessary deaths.”It didn’t have to be this way, Fidler says. Experts have long warned that a devastating pandemic was likely to hit some day, but the international community failed to put in place a mechanism to ensure equitable access to a pandemic vaccine. “So for an entirely foreseeable, expected, predicted, global problem,” he says, “we have nothing.”*Update, 29 July, 5:30 a.m.: A comment from David Fidler has been added to this story.

And it has revealed new challenges, including to peace and security”, the Secretary-General said.The current situation is leading to recession and social tensions, while several long-running conflicts have stagnated due to stalled political processes.“All governments in the subregion have supported my appeal for a global ceasefire - and I count on all countries in Southeast Asia to translate that commitment into meaningful change on the ground”, he added.Regional cooperation praisedThe new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and the pandemic was declared in March. Globally, there have been more than 16.5 million cases, with nearly 657,000 deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Wednesday.While the disease arrived in Southeast Asia earlier than in the rest of the globe, the UN chief commended governments for acting swiftly to battle the pandemic.On average, they took 17 days to declare a state of emergency or lockdown after 50 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, according to the policy brief.“Containment measures have spared Southeast Asia the degree of suffering and upheaval seen elsewhere,” said Mr. Guterres, who also praised cooperation among the countries.Four critical areas for responseThe Secretary-General underlined four areas that will be critical to ensuring recovery from the pandemic leads to a more sustainable, resilient and inclusive future for Southeast Asia.The first – tackling inequality in income, health care and social protection – will require short-term stimulus measures as well as long-term policy changes, he said.Mr. Guterres also advised countries to bridge the digital divide so that no one is left behind in an ever-more-connected world.ILO/Marcel CrozetFactory workers in an assembly line in Cambodia.Due to the over dependence on coal and other industries of the past, he encouraged “greening” the economy, including to create future jobs.Upholding human rights, protecting civic space and promoting transparency are all intrinsic to an effective response, he concluded.Advance gender equality“Central to these efforts is the need to advance gender equality, address upsurges in gender-based violence, and target women in all aspects of economic recovery and stimulus plans,” the UN chief said.“This will mitigate the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on women, and is also one of the surest avenues to sustainable, rapid, and inclusive recovery for all.”Coronavirus Portal & News UpdatesReaders can find information and guidance on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from the UN, World Health Organization and UN agencies here.

She estimated more than 1,500 members of the group gave their responses.The questionnaire asked users to identify which symptoms they were experiencing, and allowed them to add symptoms Lambert hadn't considered.In all, patients reported 98 different symptoms they attributed to their COVID-19 diagnosis. In part, those symptoms included dizziness, anxiety, headache, rashes, joint pain, shortness of breath, heartburn, diarrhea and fevers. They also reported difficulty with memory, thinking, sleep and vision.Fauci disputes viral video: Scientific data shows 'hydroxychloroquine is not effective'July 29, 202002:16More than a quarter of the respondents said they experienced ongoing pain, such as body aches, nerve pain and joint pain.All participants remained anonymous, making it impossible to confirm their diagnosis or symptoms with a physician. And it's impossible to tease out which symptoms may be directly linked to COVID-19 infection, such as fever, and which might be linked to overall stress and anxiety of being in a pandemic.Let our news meet your inbox.

The name, she said, was inspired by the hat she threw on the day she went in for her COVID-19 test back in April.""I hadn't washed my hair in like three days, and it was just gross, so I threw the hat on,"" she said. ""The group is named after my squirrel trucker hat.""The nickname stuck, and is now used by many doctors and organizations who identify with the long-haulers.Watson is not part of Survivor Corps, but is not surprised by the survey's findings.""I just talked to someone the other day who has double vision,"" Watson said.

In so doing, the district joins a growing number of utilities nationwide using waste to monitor virus levels in the local population and potentially learn about a surge even before the new infections show up in daily case counts.The district plans to share the information with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, an agency that includes the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.Scott Firmin, director of wastewater services at the Portland Water District, said samples from the facility’s Portland and Westbrook treatment plants will be tested weekly and potentially more often depending on interest and on “where the data takes us.”Portland Water District employee Chris Cogan operates a machine on Tuesday that collects samples of wastewater for testing. A lab at Saint Joseph’s College in Standish then tests the samples for fragments of the virus that causes COVID-19 in hopes of monitoring virus trends in the local communities.  Photo courtesy of Portland Water District And at just $120 per sample, compared to $1,200 for other tests, Firmin views the three-month pilot project as another cost-effective way of monitoring the virus on a large scale rather than through testing of individuals.“We’ll be testing anybody, essentially, who is contributing to our sewer flow,” Firmin said in an interview. “So it is capturing a larger population.”Looking for the telltale biological “signals” of COVID-19 in the waste flushed down the toilet is not a new concept. Testing of wastewater has helped health researchers around the world detect and track outbreaks of polio, Hepatitis A and other infectious diseases and has even been used to track illegal drug use in some places.Fragments of the virus that causes COVID-19 show up in the waste of infected individuals. Although scientific studies published in May suggested that the virus can survive in stool, studies are ongoing about the infection risk. And the wastewater treatment and disinfection process should kill any virus at that stage.However, the presence of either active or inactive pieces of the virus could be useful sentinel tools in tracking COVID-19’s prevalence in a community.Last week, the Greater Augusta Utility District began weekly testing of wastewater but is sending its samples to a Massachusetts-based laboratory, Biobot, that is testing samples from across the country. Augusta applied for and received a $24,000 grant from the Keep Maine Healthy fund to cover the estimated $1,200-per-test costs.RelatedSewage could provide data on COVID-19’s prevalence in Augusta areaFacilities in four other communities in Maine – Bangor, Bath, Rockland and Sanford – conducted limited testing of wastewater in May, according to the Maine DEP.The three-month project between Portland Water District and Saint Joseph’s College is somewhat unique, according to the partner organizations.Saint Joseph’s College is using a testing method developed by Idexx Laboratories, the Westbrook-based veterinary diagnostics firm that is helping to dramatically expand COVID-19 testing capability at the Maine CDC’s lab in Augusta.The test will look for RNA fragments of the virus in waste and then use the detected levels to attempt to extrapolate the virus’ potential presence in the wider community. Studies have suggested that people with COVID-19 may begin “shedding” the virus in their waste days before they begin exhibiting symptoms.“Building a unique partnership between an educational institution and a public utility can provide an early warning to our public health systems,” Yolanda Brooks, an assistant professor of biology at Saint Joseph’s College and the primary investigator, said in a statement. “Previous studies have demonstrated that (the virus) . . . is shed in feces. Evaluating concentrations at the community level can help us monitor the number of cases including symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, sub-clinical, and asymptomatic cases.”The testing being used by Saint Joseph’s is up to 90 percent cheaper than other methods and has the capability to detect the virus in low-prevalence areas, according to college and water district officials. Firmin said that means the system could be a useful tool for other wastewater facilities in Maine, a rural state with few densely populated areas.“There is a hope what we are doing is developing a Maine-specific program that may be of interest to other utilities,” Firmin said.Maine continues to have among the nation’s lowest COVID-19 infection rates despite the still-modest-but-growing number of vacationers arriving in tourist areas from other states. On Wednesday, the Maine CDC reported 29 new confirmed or probable cases of the virus – for a total of 3,866 to date – and that deaths of individuals with COVID-19 held steady at 121.Cumberland County has consistently topped the state in terms of total cases and the per capita infection rate.Just over 52 percent of all documented cases, to date, have been among Cumberland County residents, giving the county a case rate of 69.1 infections for every 10,000 residents compared to a statewide rate of 28.9. Androscoggin County had the second-highest case rate as of Wednesday at 50.6 infections per 10,000 residents while York County had a rate of 30.7, according to data from the Maine CDC.Robert Long, spokesman for the Maine CDC, said the agency “welcomes all science-based efforts to learn more about how the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads in Maine.”“We are monitoring research on the wastewater testing to determine how it could factor into Maine CDC’s analysis of how the virus spreads and how to limit its spread,” Long said in a statement.Several large cities, including Boston, have been participating in wastewater testing programs in recent months.Data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which operates the large treatment plant located on Deer Island in Boston Harbor, showed levels of RNA from the virus spiking from late-March to mid-April before falling precipitously through early-May.Since then, the testing results showed relatively flat levels with some small peaks. Last month, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority announced a six-month, $200,000 contract with Biobot Analytics to continue regular testing of wastewater.Related HeadlinesSewage could provide data on COVID-19’s prevalence in Augusta area Invalid username/password.

Plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients might prove useful in preventing infection as well as in treatment, scientists say.                        Lindsey Wasson/Reuters                    If you're bitten or scratched by an animal with rabies, your doctor can give you a shot to prevent the virus from taking hold in you and causing an infection. The same concept is now being put to the test for the coronavirus. Most people who get sick with COVID-19 produce antibodies in their blood that seem to protect them from reinfection. A study is now underway to see whether an infusion of those antibodies can protect someone who has been exposed to the virus and is at high risk of infection. One of the first volunteers for this study is a physician who treats transplant patients at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Jonathan Orens had a close brush with the coronavirus involving not his work, but his family. His daughter from Los Angeles wanted to come home to be near her sister, who was about to give birth to her first baby. Orens says the traveling daughter was careful about protecting her health in Los Angeles and did everything she could think of to stay safe on her flight to Baltimore.  ""She wore a mask, she wore gloves, she had sanitizer, she had wipes,"" he says. ""The load on the plane was relatively small."" They chose the Fourth of July as a travel day, knowing that even fewer people were likely to be traveling that day. ""We actually bought the two seats in the row to keep her away from everybody else."" She wore masks through the airports and in the car ride back to her parents' house. Once there, she kept her distance from them. Just to be sure, about a week after she arrived, she and her parents went for coronavirus testing. Though she had no symptoms, ""she was positive,"" Orens says. ""And fortunately my wife and I were negative."" But they were still at high risk of contracting the disease, given the close contact with their daughter.  Shots - Health News Market For Blood Plasma From COVID-19 Survivors Heats UpAs luck would have it, one of Orens' colleagues at Hopkins was just starting a study to see if purified blood serum from people who have recovered from COVID-19 — called convalescent plasma — could prevent the disease in someone else. Orens and his wife, who are in their early 60s, are entering an age group at higher risk of serious disease if infected with the coronavirus. They signed up for the experimental treatment. Half the people in this clinical trial get an intravenous infusion of convalescent plasma, while the other half get an infusion of blood serum that had been donated before the pandemic emerged (so it lacked protective antibodies). Neither the participants nor the doctors treating them know who's getting what. The infusion took about an hour, Orens says. ""I didn't feel anything except for the pinprick from the IV, and we went on our merry way."" He now returns to the clinic for regular blood tests. ""We'll follow him along to see if he develops symptoms and if he turns positive,"" says Dr. Shmuel Shoham, who is directing the study. Shoham says he plans to enroll up to 500 patients — though, in the best-case scenario, if the treatment is highly effective he won't need to study that many people. In addition to recruiting patients in Baltimore, ""right now we have sites in Houston, sites in Alabama,"" Shoham says. ""We're opening up additional sites in Dallas and Arizona. We have sites all over Southern California."" He's also involved in a second study that looks at whether plasma will prevent serious illness in people who are infected but not sick. He says if both of these strategies work, they could help a lot of people, even in the absence of a vaccine. ""That would give people a lot of confidence, I think, to go back to school, go back to work,"" he says, ""because if somebody gets sick it's not a tragedy --because we can protect them and protect those around them."" These studies are among a growing number of experiments involving convalescent plasma, both as preventive measures and as treatments for COVID-19. Dr. Jessica Justman at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York tried to launch a similar study this spring. Good news for New York — but a complication for her study — was that the disease had largely abated in the city, and she didn't have luck recruiting people to participate. ""Compared to March and April, people have become less worried, less scared of COVID and perhaps a little bit less inclined to go for a preventive treatment,"" Justman says.  Shots - Health News Cows Help With COVID-19 Treatment, No BullThat situation could turn around if the disease roars back in her area. And Justman says the idea is well worth pursuing. A similar strategy works against other diseases — not just rabies, but hepatitis B, botulism and a potentially serious viral infection in babies called respiratory syncytial virus. In fact, this general strategy dates back more than a century. Shohan was involved in a study that attempted to use convalescent serum to treat the flu, and it was not successful — so it isn't a cure-all. Piggybacking on this strategy, drug companies are gearing up to manufacture antibodies, instead of collecting blood from recovered patients. But those products — monoclonal antibodies — wouldn't be cheap. ""What I like about the convalescent plasma idea is that if it worked, I see it as something that could really be scalable in resource-limited settings,"" Justman says, referring to developing countries where expensive pharmaceuticals are frequently out of reach. ""And I think that's where convalescent plasma has this really great potential."" As for the Orens family, nobody fell ill — whether that was due to in part to treatment or luck, nobody knows. Their quarantine period ended just in time for a quick trip to New York after the baby's birth to see the new mom. ""The plan is to drive up after she is out of the hospital. Hopefully, everything will go well, and we will all be outside,"" Orens says. ""We will see the baby from a distance. I've already been informed by my daughter that I am not allowed to get anywhere near the baby. And then we will turn around and come back to Baltimore."" It's hardly the way he was hoping to greet his first grandchild, he says, ""however it's the price we have to pay to bring this pandemic under control."" The researchers in Baltimore hope to know by mid-September whether the convalescent plasma will in fact inoculate people from COVID-19.

The laundry is always impossible because I’m just lifting and it’s heavy and my hands will start to hurt and swell,” said Katrina Webb, a “long-haul” COVID-19 survivor.That's what some survivors are being called -- those who were considered “recovered” from the deadly disease but still deal with painful and sometimes dangerous after-effects of the disease weeks and months after their initial infection.“It’s gotten to the point where it’s been difficult to care for myself,” Webb said. “My daughter is with her grandma now just because it was too hard for her to stay with me when I wasn’t able to do the things you’re supposed to do as a parent.”LocalSan Diego CountyJun 27Latest Coronavirus Impacts: 282 New COVID-19 Cases, 5 Additional DeathsSDSO36 mins agoSDSO Nurse, 1 Other Arrested on Theft, Conspiracy Charges in Connection With North County BurglariesWebb, an engineer from Rancho Bernardo, is part of a support group that has spread to every part of the globe called Survivor Corps. In four months, the Facebook group has grown to over 81,000 members. The group is the brain child of Diana Berrent, who had COVID-19 in March and was looking for support from others like her.The group started as an opportunity for people to connect, and Berrent said it has shifted into a group of volunteers offering valuable information to researchers.Over 1,000 members have participated in a conducted by researchers from the University of Indiana documenting the most common issues post-COVID-19 issues. They include things like chronic fatigue, hair loss, strokes, and COVID on-set Diabetes.“These doctors and scientists are learning from us,” said Jennica Harris, a mom from San Marcos. “And it’s good that there is a place where we can go to when we feel so alone and nobody else can understand what someone else is going through.”Harris’ husband, a commercial pilot, was called into work. She says he went to Mexico for one night.“He didn’t leave his room, just stayed in his hotel room and got back and I was really paranoid to get him home, so I quarantined him for 2 weeks in our guest bedroom, Harris said. “Within 5-10 days I started showing symptoms and so did my daughter.”Months after being diagnosed with COVID-19, both women say their bodies have been ravaged and they still can’t do everything they could do before.""I go back through my pictures, through my photo albums and I look at who I was and what my body was before and my family and how happy we were, and I sometimes wish we could go back in time and skip this entire year,"" Harris said.“I’m not the active person that I used to be,” Harris said. “I can’t do everyday activities, washing dishes, cooking, cleaning. For many months I couldn’t even hold my son. I tried to hold him when I had strength and he didn’t want me anymore. It was pretty devastating.”Many people in the group are trying to promote awareness and help people realize that even if you don’t go to the hospital and you just have “mild” symptoms your life can change.“It’s scary. Doctors don’t really know that much, so you can’t really get answers,” said Mackenzie Saideman, a Survivor Corps member from Mira Mesa. “I’m 23 years old, I’ve never had any health issues, and I’m still struggling every single day.""“I went to a music festival March 7 and then I tested positive on March 16, so I would assume that would be where I got it,” Saideman said. ""I lost my smell and taste and it’s been about four months now, actually almost four months and my sense of smell and taste is not completely back.”A June graduate of UC San Diego, Saideman says she just started working full-time. On top of starting a new job, she had to deal with life after COVID.“After two months I started experiencing abdominal pain,"" Saideman said. “I was looking on Reddit, I was looking everywhere for information. No one knew anything. I talked to my doctor and he said it’s just anxiety, but It’s my abdomen it’s not anxiety.”According to Berrent, the medical community is not tracking people who have had mild symptoms and are recovering at home. She says her group provides a place to address the gap.

Morry Gash/AP Photo  Rural Northwoods County Has Wisconsin's Highest Active COVID-19 Infection RateIron County Had Few Cases For Months. Now It's Seeing High Virus Activity.By Rob MentzerPublished: Thursday, July 30, 2020, 6:30amShare:    ListenDownloadOne of the most sparsely populated counties in Wisconsin now has the state's highest rate of active COVID-19 infections. The steep infection curve in far-northern Iron County in July follows four months when the county's total number of infections was in the single digits. Health officials say the outbreak isn't tied to any single event or institution. Rather, one public health official said it appears to be the result of ""quarantine fatigue"" that led people to cast aside social distancing practices for graduation parties, Fourth of July gatherings and other social events where the disease spread.As case counts increase in much of Wisconsin, the rural area is one of several places in the state to have seen a spike in new cases in recent weeks. It also exemplifies the disease's continuing spread from Wisconsin's urban centers into areas that previously had seen only minimal activity. Zona Wick, the former county health officer who has been rehired as a public health nurse during the crisis, said the county's low numbers throughout the first months of the crisis meant some residents became complacent about the risks.""They said, 'We're rural, our numbers are very low, so we're safe to have gatherings here in our community,'"" Wick said.There have now been 75 positive cases in the county — 68 among residents and seven among nonresidents, who may include those with seasonal properties there. Thirty-eight people have recovered; three have been hospitalized; one has died. Wick said cases are distributed across the county and not tied to a particular cluster. For example, the county's nursing homes have had no cases.In absolute terms, there are plenty of places in Wisconsin with more cases and more deaths. But for a county of 5,676 residents, the spike means Iron County's per capita rate of active cases now is higher than in any of the state's urban centers. That's in part because the great majority of cases recorded in initially hard-hit places like Milwaukee, Racine and Brown counties have now recovered, leaving them with a much smaller proportion of active cases compared to their cumulative totals.In new data published by the state Department of Health Services on Wednesday, only four of Wisconsin’s 72 counties showed more active cases than recovered ones: Iron, Juneau, Langlade and Menominee counties. Two others, Taylor and Washburn counties, had the same number of active and recovered cases. All six are rural counties.They aren't the only places in Wisconsin to see a recent spike in new cases. On Wednesday, Trempealeau County public health nurse Kaila Baer said in a statement that the western Wisconsin county was ""on the edge of moving to severe risk."" It had the seventh-highest case rate in Wisconsin per 100,000 people, according to Baer.Meanwhile, Chippewa County saw COVID-19 cases double in the last three weeks, according to a report from WQOW. There is no hospital in Iron County, and Wick said residents have traveled to Minocqua, Ashland or Ironwood, Michigan for tests. Because of an increase in new cases, the Health Department requested a National Guard-assisted testing event held in Hurley on July 24. Not all results from that event have yet been returned.""Our numbers stayed low for March, April, May and June,"" Wick said. ""For four months, our numbers didn’t go above 10. ""Quarantine fatigue is a real thing,"" she said. Those low numbers ""lulled people into complacency, into saying, 'Hey, things are safe here. It's just our family. It's just our friends. It's just people we know.' … And the virus doesn’t care.""Wisconsin Public Radio, © Copyright 2020, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.

(AP) — The governing body for high school athletics in Illinois decided Wednesday to push football and other fall sports to the spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Illinois High School Association's decision to move football, boys soccer and volleyball to a February-to-May season came hours after Gov. J.B. Pritzker barred interscholastic play for contact or intense sports such as football, wrestling and competitive cheering and dance because of the ease with which the coronavirus can spread.Cross country and golf for both boys and girls, and girls tennis and swimming will continue in their traditional fall slots.Pritzker released a list of more than three dozen sports, from boxing to bass fishing, which are ranked in terms of their risk for transmitting the highly contagious and potentially fatal virus, and accompanied by appropriate levels of participation.Summer youth sports, even with restrictions, proved costly. Dozens of students contracted COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, after attending a sports camp at Lake Zurich High School, and a teen softball team in Knox County suffered an outbreak.“This virus is unrelenting, and it spreads so easily that no amount of restrictions seems to keep it off the playing field ...,"" Pritzker said. “The toughest choice is also the safest choice.""The rules take effect Aug. 15 and also apply to adult recreational leagues, travel clubs, park district and similar programs, but not to college or professional sports.As it stands, schedules for wintertime sports like wrestling, bowling and gymnastics will not change, according to the IHSA. The displaced fall sports will follow in the spring, and the traditional spring sports baseball, track and field, girls soccer, boys tennis and others will have “summer” seasons in May and June.The plan “remains fluid,” IHSA executive director Craig Anderson said.“Changes may come, and if they do, we will be agile while putting safety and students first,” Anderson said.Under Pritzker's rules, only athletes and teams in lower-risk sports may engage in interscholastic competition. Medium-risk contests may include team scrimmages with minors' parental consent. Elementary school sports schedules have been canceled.Wednesday's was another of several appearances recently by Pritzker to publicize a troublesome coronavirus resurgence. He urged residents to pressure local officials to get tougher in areas where there's a spike.""If they don’t, they could send the entire region back to closed bars and closed restaurants, stricter limits on gatherings, or even another stay-at-home order,” Pritzker said.With 1,393 new cases confirmed Wednesday, Illinois has now reported 175,124 infections, which in most cases ended in recovery. There were 18 deaths Wednesday, with a total of 7,462 deaths connected to complications with the virus.Pritzker significantly loosened social restrictions in late June because of declining numbers. The 4,233 infections reported the week of June 14 was the lowest since the virus exploded in late March. Since mid-June, however, weekly numbers have steadily climbed again, to 9,273 last week and are on a pace this week to equal that number.Deaths have been dramatically lower, however. In June, there were 22,926 new cases and 1,566 deaths. Infections have jumped to 31,939 in July, but deaths have dropped to 548. The state public health department noted that new infections have been found in younger people, particularly those 18-29, who typically are healthier overall and able to fight the virus off.———OnlineAltered IHSA sports schedule for 2020-21: https://bit.ly/2X9Mf6jGuidelines for high schools sports: https://bit.ly/335QaVBIllinois COVID-19 cases by week: https://bit.ly/30Y4qNn———Check out more of the AP’s coronavirus coverage at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak———Follow Political Writer John O’Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnorCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

California and Florida set single-day death records. A virus patient recovered after a rare double lung transplant.Right NowFlorida reported 253 additional deaths, and Arizona reported more than 150 — record daily highs for both states.Here’s what you need to know:Herman Cain dies after being hospitalized with the virus.The Diamond Princess outbreak offers a case study in aerosol transmission.Much of the U.S. presidential election battleground is now in the ‘red zone.’Young children may carry the coronavirus at high levels, a small study finds.The U.S. economy has shrunk at the fastest pace on record.Here are some key U.S. developments you may have missed.Newly compiled statistics show the virus’s deadly path across Europe in the spring.ImageHerman Cain in 2014. He attended Mr. Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Okla., last month and tested positive for the coronavirus shortly after.Credit...Molly Riley/Associated PressHerman Cain dies after being hospitalized with the virus.Herman Cain, who made a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2012 race and was a recent contender for a top Federal Reserve job, died after being hospitalized with the coronavirus, according to an announcement posted to his personal website and on his verified social media accounts.Mr. Cain, 74, was the former chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza. President Trump said in 2019 that he was planning to nominate him to the Federal Reserve Board, but Mr. Cain withdrew his name as he battled old accusations of sexual harassment, the same ones that had halted his earlier presidential campaign.“We knew when he was first hospitalized with Covid-19 that this was going to be a rough fight,” Dan Calabrese, editor of HermanCain.com, wrote on the website. “Although he was basically pretty healthy in recent years, he was still in a high-risk group because of his history with cancer.”In 2018, Mr. Cain formed the America Fighting Back political action committee, which had a mission of publicly rebutting what he believes is misinformation about Mr. Trump.“We’re offering a compelling, solid refutation to what you hear from the media and the rest of the left about President Trump and conservative ideas,” he said at the time.Mr. Cain was admitted to a hospital with the coronavirus at the beginning of July, and it looked initially like he would recover.“There were hopeful indicators, including a mere five days ago when doctors told us they thought he would eventually recover, although it wouldn’t be quick,” Mr. Calabrese wrote in the announcement of Mr. Cain’s death.Mr. Cain attended Mr. Trump’s indoor rally in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20. A few hours before the event, the Trump campaign disclosed that six staff members who had been working on the rally had tested positive for the virus during a routine screening. Two members of the Secret Service also tested positive there, people familiar with the matter said.In a video on his website, Mr. Cain described the rally and he said he had worn a mask while in groups of people. But he also posted photographs of himself on social media that showed him without a mask and surrounded by people in the arena.The statement on Mr. Cain’s Twitter account in early July announcing he had tested positive said that there was “no way of knowing for sure how or where Mr. Cain contracted the coronavirus.”Mr. Cain, who was an official surrogate for Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign, wrote an op-ed after the rally in which he defended the event, writing, “The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa.”On July 8, the top health official in Tulsa said that a surge in cases in and around Tulsa was probably connected to Mr. Trump’s campaign rally.The Diamond Princess outbreak offers a case study in aerosol transmission.ImageThe Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Yokohama, Japan, in February. More than 700 of the 3,711 people on board tested positive for the coronavirus.Credit...Kim Kyung Hoon/ReutersA new analysis of one of the most mysterious and dramatic virus outbreaks — aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship early this year — points to small, floating droplets as a primary driver of virus transmission.The analysis used computer simulations to model the outbreak on the ship, in the same way disease modelers have reconstructed the virus’s spread with computer modeling. It found that small, floating particles accounted for about 60 percent of new infections on the Diamond Princess.The new findings, if confirmed, would have major implications for making indoor spaces safer and choosing among a panoply of personal protective equipment.The computer modeling adds a new dimension of support to an accumulating body of evidence implicating small, airborne droplets in multiple outbreaks, including at a Chinese restaurant and among choir members in Washington State.“Many people have argued that airborne transmission is happening, but no one had numbers for it,” said Parham Azimi, an indoor-air researcher at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the lead author of the study. “In this paper, we provide the first real estimates for what that number could be, at least in the case of this cruise ship.”One researcher not involved in the study, Julian Tang, an honorary associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, said the paper was “the first attempt, as far as I know, to formally compare the different routes of coronavirus transmission, especially of short versus long-range aerosols.”Much of the U.S. presidential election battleground is now in the ‘red zone.’ImageMiami Beach. Florida has reported two successive record daily death tolls: 186 on Tuesday and 216 on Wednesday.Credit...Saul Martinez for The New York TimesThe coronavirus has been spreading rapidly in four of six key battleground states crucial to the presidential election in November — Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin. The states are among 21 recently declared to be in the “red zone” in a report by the federal government because of the substantial number of new virus cases reported there each day.If the presumptive Democratic nominee and former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., wins the states won by Hillary Clinton four years ago, many combinations of any three of six swing states would be enough to defeat President Trump. In addition to the four swing states labeled “red zones,” the list includes Michigan and Pennsylvania, which have not seen major spikes in cases in recent weeks.Already many states are revisiting their mail-in voting policies, so that voters will not have to go to polling stations and risk infection. The six swing states have either always allowed relatively easy mail-in voting or have recently made it easier. Currently, eight states allow mail-in or absentee ballots only with an approved excuse. The issue continues to be a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Trump on Thursday raised the idea of delaying the election until people could “properly, securely and safely vote???”The president, however, does not have the authority to delay Election Day, which by law takes place the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.Republicans on Capitol Hill attempted on Thursday to distance themselves from President Trump’s latest tweet that tried to undermine the legitimacy of the November election as he trails badly in the polls, uniformly rejecting his suggestion that the election should be delayed.It was a rare instance of Republicans in Congress speaking out publicly against Mr. Trump, and a break with their usual approach of refusing to comment on his incendiary statements and actions.A recent New York Times analysis also suggests that the increasing number of virus-related deaths is damaging Republican support in some communities.On Wednesday, the country surpassed 150,000 deaths, and deaths have been on the rise in Arizona, Wisconsin and Florida, which on Wednesday reported more than 216 fatalities, according to a New York Times database, surpassing its previous high of 186, which was recorded the day before.And some states that are considered safe for Mr. Trump have been struggling to contain the virus in recent weeks and are among the 21 states labeled red zones: Alabama, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee.Young children may carry the coronavirus at high levels, a small study finds.ImageVirus testing for young children in Kolkata, India. Experts said the findings of a new study should factor in to the debate over reopening schools.Credit...Dibyangshu Sarkar/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIt has been a comforting refrain in the national conversation about reopening schools: Young children are mostly spared by the coronavirus and don’t seem to spread it to others, at least not very often.But on Thursday, a study introduced an unwelcome wrinkle into this narrative. Infected children have at least as much of the coronavirus in their noses and throats as infected adults, according to the research.Indeed, children younger than 5 may host up to 100 times as much of the virus in the upper respiratory tract as adults, the authors found.That measurement does not necessarily prove children are passing the virus to others. Still, the findings should factor into the debate over reopening schools, several experts said.“I’ve heard lots of people saying, ‘Well, kids aren’t susceptible, kids don’t get infected.’ And this clearly shows that’s not true,” said Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.The researchers analyzed samples collected with nasopharyngeal swabs from March 23 to April 27 at drive-through testing sites in Chicago and from people who came to the hospital for any reason, including symptoms of Covid-19.They looked at swabs taken from 145 people: 46 children younger than age 5; 51 children ages 5 to 17; and 48 adults ages 18 to 65. Older children and adults had similar levels of genetic fragments of the virus, by one important measure. Children younger than 5 had significantly lower levels. Still, the upper limit of the range was comparable to that of older children and adults.The study is not without caveats: It was small, and did not specify the participants’ race or sex, or whether they had underlying conditions. The tests looked for viral RNA, genetic pieces of the coronavirus, rather than the live virus itself. (Its genetic material is RNA, not DNA.)Still, experts were alarmed to learn that young children may carry significant amounts of the coronavirus.“We are going to be reopening day care and elementary schools,” said Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. If these results hold up, “then yeah, I’d be worried.”The U.S. economy has shrunk at the fastest pace on record.ImageA food bank in Davis, Calif., last week. The last quarter’s economic collapse was unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its severity.Credit...Max Whittaker for The New York TimesEconomic output fell at its fastest pace on record in spring as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses across the United States to close and kept millions shut in their homes for weeks.Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services produced — fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. On an annualized basis, G.D.P. fell at a rate of 32.9 percent.The collapse was unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its severity. By comparison, economic output fell 4 percent during the entirety of the Great Recession a decade ago — and took 18 months to sink that far. The only possible comparisons in modern American history came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War II, both of which occurred before the advent of modern economic statistics.What’s more, fears are growing that after rebounding strongly in May and June, the economy has run out of steam, with many states closing businesses again after coronavirus cases surged.At the same time, the $600 supplemental weekly unemployment payment from the federal government is ending, a potentially crippling financial blow to millions.Also on Thursday, the government reported that 1.43 million people filed new claims for state unemployment benefits.It was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded a million, an unheard-of figure before the coronavirus pandemic. And it was the second weekly increase in a row after nearly four months of declines, a sign of how the resurgence in cases has undercut the economy’s nascent recovery.Here are some key U.S. developments you may have missed.A $600-a-week federal unemployment benefit that has helped keep tens of millions of Americans economically afloat in the pandemic is likely to lapse as scheduled on Friday, a top White House official said Wednesday, as the prospects for a quick compromise between Democrats and the Trump administration on a new round of aid sank further.

California recorded more than 185 deaths, along with a record number of new cases, more than 12,300, according to a New York Times database. On Thursday, Florida reported 253 additional deaths, the third day in a row the state has broken its record for single-day deaths. Arizona also broke its single-day death record, announcing on Thursday it had more than 150 fatalities.

In its worst weeks of the pandemic, England had more than twice the usual number of deaths.Credit...Pool photo by Steve ParsonsEurope had nearly 50 percent more deaths than normal at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, according to data compiled by Britain’s and France’s national statistics agencies, with tens of thousands more people dying the last week of March and the first week of April than in previous years.As Europe became the epicenter of the pandemic in the late winter and early spring, many countries implemented nationwide lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus, which was already killing thousands. Most of the excess deaths were in four big, hard-hit countries — Britain, Italy, Spain and France.In their worst weeks, Belgium, England, France and Spain all had more than twice as many deaths than was usual for the time of year.England had the second-highest peak mortality after Spain in Europe, and “the longest continuous period of excess mortality,” according to a report published by Britain’s Office for National Statistics on Wednesday. Britain had registered over 55,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths as of mid-July, and is the worst-hit country in Europe.Although European countries encountered wide discrepancies in their excess deaths, most saw a rise over the course of two deadly weeks, from March 30 to April 12. During the last week of March, the deadliest across Europe with 33,000 excess deaths, Spain alone registered over 12,500 more deaths than would be expected when compared with data from 2016 to 2019, a 155 percent increase, and Italy over 6,500, according to data provided by the French national statistics agency, INSEE. The following week, Belgium recorded over 2,000 excess deaths, an increase of nearly 110 percent compared with data from previous years.The coronavirus has depleted nursing homes across the continent, infected thousands of health care workers, and revealed how some of the most stable countries in the world were unprepared for a pandemic, although several national security agencies had defined it as one of the most critical threats that their countries could face.The surge in deaths was highest among elderly people, according to the statistics provided by Britain and France, with northern Italy and central Spain the hardest-hit areas across the continent.Alaska’s fish plants are seeing virus outbreaks.ImageA fishing fleet in Alaska in 2018. Roughly 26,000 processing workers head to plants in the state each year.Credit...Yereth Rosen/ReutersOutbreaks have swept through three Alaska fish-processing facilities and a factory trawler in recent weeks, stressing an industry already facing an unstable market for seafood.Roughly 26,000 processing workers head to plants in Alaska each year, the bulk of them in the summertime. Many work the red salmon season out of Bristol Bay, the largest red salmon fishery in the world and the source of most of America’s wild-caught salmon.Conditions in fish plants mirror those in meat-processing plants, with people living together and working long shifts in close quarters. Alaska put in place strict procedures and required monitoring, quarantining and testing out of concern that processing workers and fishermen, many who come from out of state, would spread the virus into Alaskan communities.The plan largely worked and Alaska’s case total stayed low until July. But as cases began to spike in recent weeks, resident workers — not those from other states — brought the virus into fish plants, said Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer. “It unfortunately has taken off pretty quickly,” she said. “It’s so hard to mitigate the spread once you get it in the plant.”Alaska has had 20 coronavirus deaths and about 3,500 cases, according to a New York Times database.At the Copper River Seafoods plant in Anchorage, 76 out of 135 people had tested positive as of Wednesday, Dr. Zink said. In Seward, a small town south of Anchorage, 139 out of 252 workers tested positive. At Alaska Glacier Seafoods, in Juneau, 62 out of 150 workers were positive. And the American Triumph, a factory trawler that docked in Dutch Harbor, had 85 cases out of the 119 people on board, she said.But there have been no outbreaks at fish plants in Bristol Bay, where the season is wrapping up. Most workers there came from elsewhere and didn’t mingle with the locals, said Nicole Kimball, a fisheries analyst with the Pacific Seafood Processors Association. “The key there was a closed campus,” she said. “People took it very seriously to keep their doors closed.”Outbreaks at plants force production to cease while facilities are cleaned and workers are tested, further pressing a salmon industry that analysts say is facing decreased restaurant demand and a glut in the retail sector. Processors are paying fishermen at Bristol Bay half as much per pound as they were last year, said Andy Wink, executive director of the Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association.That stings, he said. “It makes it hard to enjoy all the sacrifice people put in to make the season safe and successful.”GLOBAL ROUNDUPThe death toll rises in Australia, which once had the outbreak under control.ImageAustralian Defence Force personnel at a nursing home in Melbourne, Victoria. Such facilities account for many of the new coronavirus cases.Credit...William West/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAustralia has recorded its deadliest day since the pandemic began, with 13 deaths reported on Wednesday, all in the southern state of Victoria, which also had 723 new cases. A total of 21 new cases were recorded in other states, as the authorities tightened borders and local restrictions.The record numbers are largely the result of outbreaks in nursing homes, as well as people going into work while symptomatic, the authorities said.“This is incredibly serious. And every time somebody doesn’t do the right thing, every time somebody contributes to the spread of the virus, then that means that another family will be having to plan a funeral,” Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.“Unless everyone plays their part, this lockdown will not end anytime soon,” he added.While Australia’s figures pale in comparison to the tens of thousands of new cases each day in the United States, they are significant in a country that had appeared to contain the virus to manageable levels before an outbreak in early July, which is thought to have spread from hotel quarantine facilities in Melbourne.Masks, which the health authorities had advised only for those experiencing symptoms, have since become mandatory in the city. Starting on Sunday they will be enforced across the state of Victoria, where restrictions on private gatherings have also increased.“We have now been in this lockdown now for some weeks, and we are not getting the results we would hope for,” Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters in Canberra. The high rates of community transmission, he added, were of “great concern.”Here are other developments from around the globe:President Adama Barrow of Gambia is in self-isolation for two weeks, after the vice president, Isatou Touray, tested positive for the virus, Reuters reported.The Hong Kong government said on Thursday that it would again allow restaurant dining until 6 p.m., only a day after banning dine-in arrangements for breakfast and lunch. The measure had quickly triggered a backlash, with social media filled with images of people eating outside in the rain and summer heat. Hong Kong is seeing its most severe surge in infections, with more than 100 new cases daily for the past week.As cases spiked in Tokyo, with another daily high on Thursday of 367 new coronavirus infections, Gov. Yuriko Koike requested that karaoke venues and bars and restaurants serving alcohol close by 10 p.m. from Aug. 3 through the end of the month. Businesses that cooperate will be offered 200,000 yen, or about $1,900. The initiative comes as the country’s health ministry announced a record 1,264 new cases.Quarantines are the latest way to silence dissent in China, according to human rights activists. Activists in quarantine are often detained without their families’ knowledge, and are typically “not allowed to communicate with the outside world, held in a secret location and not given the option to self-isolate at home,” said Frances Eve, deputy director of research at Chinese Human Rights Defenders. “This treatment is de facto enforced disappearance,” she said.Anyone with symptoms of Covid-19 in Britain will now have to isolate for 10 days instead of seven, as the authorities said they may take new measures to hold off a second wave of infections that has started to appear across Europe. More than 700 new coronavirus cases were detected in Britain on Wednesday, and earlier this week the authorities reimposed a 14-day quarantine period for anyone returning from Spain.An experimental vaccine from Johnson & Johnson protected monkeys from infection.ImageThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine candidate is the second this week to show promising results in monkeys.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesAn experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson protected monkeys from infection in a new study.Unlike many other vaccines in development that might require two injections, the Johnson & Johnson candidate shielded monkeys with just one dose, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Nature.It is the second vaccine candidate this week to show promising results in monkeys.After a single injection of the vaccine, scientists waited six weeks and then infected the monkeys with the coronavirus. Six of the seven vaccine variants offered monkeys partial protection, but the seventh proved more powerful: Five out of six monkeys that received it had no detectable virus at all.It was this best-performing vaccine that Johnson & Johnson used last week to begin its first human safety trial, a so-called Phase 1 trial, in Europe. If it goes well, the company hopes by September to enter a Phase 3 trial, which tests not only whether the vaccine is safe, but also whether it works.“This week has been good — now we have two vaccines that work in monkeys,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the studies. “It’s nice to be upbeat for a change.”But she cautioned that the new results shouldn’t be used to rush large-scale trials in humans. “We just can’t take shortcuts,” she said.With a record death toll, Brazil opens its borders to foreign travelers.ImageBrasilia International Airport in May. Brazil has barred foreign visitors since March.Credit...Ueslei Marcelino/ReutersOn a day it reported a record number of coronavirus deaths, the Brazilian government decided to reopen its borders to foreigners, who have been barred since March.The decree published on Wednesday night said visitors were now allowed to fly to Brazil, as long as they could prove that they were covered by health insurance for the duration of their travels.Other countries in Latin America, like Argentina and Colombia, that are reporting far fewer cases than Brazil are keeping their borders closed to international flights.Travelers crossing the border through land and sea are still barred with some exceptions, and international airports in five of Brazil’s 27 states are still forbidden to most incoming foreigners. The government didn’t offer an explanation for its decision.Brazil has now reported more than 90,000 deaths and 2.5 million cases of Covid-19, the highest figures after the United States.The president of the council of state health departments, Carlos Eduardo de Oliveira Lula, told the newspaper O Globo that he didn’t believe the new decision would have much of an impact on the country’s raging public health crisis.“With the number of cases we have, the biggest risk is the opposite, to other countries,” he said. “I very much doubt any would want to come here at this moment.”After a rare double lung transplant, a Covid-19 patient is released from the hospital.Image“I want people to see what this virus does to a person,” said Mayra Ramirez of Chicago, the recipient of the double transplant. Credit...Sebastian Hidalgo for The New York TimesShe was the first Covid-19 patient in the United States to receive a double lung transplant, and now she is back home.The last thing Mayra Ramirez, 28, remembers is calling her family from the emergency room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago and telling them she was about to be put on a ventilator. She needed her mother to make medical decisions for her.Ms. Ramirez did not wake up for more than six weeks, in early June, and only then did she learn about the double transplant.On Wednesday, she went home from the hospital.“I’m pretty sure that if I had been at another center, they would have just ended care and let me die,” she said in an interview on Wednesday.Ms. Ramirez is one of a small but growing number of patients whose lungs have been destroyed by the coronavirus, and whose only hope of survival is a lung transplant.The surgery is considered a desperate measure, and is reserved for people with fatal, irreversible lung damage. Doctors do not want to remove a person’s lungs if there is any chance they will heal. Over all, only about 2,700 lung transplants were performed in the United States last year.Patients must be sick enough to need a transplant, and yet also strong enough to recover from the operation. With a new disease, doctors are still learning how to strike that balance.“It’s such a paradigm change,” said Dr. Ankit Bharat, who operated on Ms. Ramirez. “Lung transplant has not been considered a treatment option for an infectious disease, so people need to get a little bit more of a comfort level with it.”Need help confronting the stress of school reopenings?If you’re dealing with uncertainty about school options this fall, here are some ideas to consider.Reporting was contributed by Manuela Andreoni, Maggie Astor, Livia Albeck-Ripka, Julia Calderone, Benedict Carey, Ben Casselman, Michael Cooper, Marie Fazio, Jim Glanz, Denise Grady, Annie Karni, Apoorva Mandavilli, Zach Montague, Julia O’Malley, Elian Peltier, Austin Ramzy, Motoko Rich, Jeanna Smialek, Nelson D.

It has made clear that some of the most vulnerable populations and undervalued professions in our society are not only the hardest hit during times of crisis but also the ones we rely upon the most.Have you read?            COVID-19 is likely to increase youth unemployment in Africa, this is how business can mitigate the damage             How youth and technology can drive Africa's COVID-19 response             Why the world needs the youth revolution more than ever Across the globe, the pandemic has had a particularly severe impact on youth employment owing to disruptions to education, job layoffs and income losses and increased barriers to job market entry. For those young people who are still pursuing education, the pandemic is likely to result in unprecedented new inequalities upon graduation. There are more young people in the world than ever before and they are critical members of the global society driving forward ideas, innovations and movements. Youth are also on the frontlines of other major economic transformations across the global economy, including digitalization, automation, climate action and others. We believe in the opportunity for a Great Reset – our society has the capacity to rise to this challenge. If we seize this, much as we did in the aftermath of World War II, we know a better, more equitable, compassionate, prosperous global economy is possible.  The numbers on youth employment are inAccording to the COVID-19 Risks Outlook Report, 49.3% of senior risk experts believe high levels of structural unemployment, especially among youth, is one of the most likely consequences of the pandemic; 43.8% believe this to be an area of great global concern.              Top 10 most likely consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic                          Image: World Economic Forum            The recent ILO survey on youth unemployment also finds that youth around the world have been severely and disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis, especially young women. More than one in six young people are out of work as a result of the pandemic. Meanwhile, 178 million youth are employed in sectors that have been hit hard by the pandemic and are facing layoffs and 131 million of these young people are informally employed.The survey also finds that young women are “more likely to experience significant challenges in combining their job with an increased amount of unpaid care work.” Furthermore, for many young women who already face various forms of economic marginalization, there could be compounding challenges or disenfranchisement.  Skills-proofing for the future of workBeyond the COVID-19 pandemic, we are facing one of the greatest workforce challenges of the 21st century: the skills gap for young workers in the global economy. Skills-proofing will be essential as the speed of change and disruptions continue to transform the future of work. Pragmatic and effective mechanisms will be required to create new opportunities that meet the evolving technological and economic contexts and demands. As the latest Jobs of Tomorrow Report from the World Economic Forum notes, demand for digital and human factors will continue to rise, resulting in a greater demand for care economy and green economy jobs, in particular, among other clusters of professions. It is important to ensure that young people are equipped and empowered to combat long-standing challenges to our society, particularly the threat of climate change.  Call to action: prioritizing youth in economic recovery efforts An urgent and comprehensive response to tackling youth unemployment during COVID-19 must be a crucial aspect of countries’ economic recovery strategies. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the foundations of our global economy, prepare youth to thrive in the future of work, generate new widespread prosperity and lay the groundwork for a safer, cleaner, greener and more equitable world. Investing in and re-skilling people now can help us get them back to work immediately while building more just, inclusive and resilient economies.What is the World Economic Forum doing about the coronavirus outbreak?Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic requires global cooperation among governments, international organizations and the business community, which is at the centre of the World Economic Forum’s mission as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation.How can we collaborate to stop the spread of COVID-19?Since its launch on 11 March, the Forum’s COVID Action Platform has brought together 1,667 stakeholders from 1,106 businesses and organizations to mitigate the risk and impact of the unprecedented global health emergency that is COVID-19. The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action.As an organization, the Forum has a track record of supporting efforts to contain epidemics. In 2017, at our Annual Meeting, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched – bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines. CEPI is currently supporting the race to develop a vaccine against this strand of the coronavirus.ShowIn light of this, Canadian Shapers have penned an open letter to the Government of Canada urging the government to expedite investments in youth training and upskilling as a crucial part of its COVID-19 recovery strategy. This Reskill4Recovery initiative, lays out the rationale for this investment and breaks it down into three recommendations:Invest in future-proofed and essential skills for youth entering the workforce and people whose work is in transition;Invest in sector-specific skills and technical training to address the most pressing problems facing our society, particularly climate change;Invest immediately in job-creation programmes.As the COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting repercussions on youth, such actions at the state or national level can help bring forward inclusive youth voices. Young people are crucial to economic recovery efforts. Pushing our national institutions to provide new opportunities for those who have been squeezed out of the job market and address systemic long-term challenges, like climate change and inequality, is paramount to the Great Reset.ShareLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.Written byPuninda Thind, Vice Curator, Toronto Hub, George Patrick Richard Benson, Global Shaper, Vancouver HubDaniela Pico, Curator, Toronto HubDominique Souris, Co-founder and Executive Director, Youth Climate LabAna Gonzalez Guerrero, Co-founder and Managing Director, Youth Climate LabRita Steele, Global Shaper, Vancouver Hub, Alyssa McDonald, Vice Curator, Vancouver Hub, The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.The World Economic Forum COVID Action PlatformLearn more Explore contextCOVID-19Explore the latest strategic trends, research and analysis Subscribe for updatesA weekly update of what’s on the Global AgendaMore on              COVID-19                                    View all  Solar keeps the lights on for rural Kenyans during pandemic blackoutsAs the pandemic and extreme weather disrupt electricity supplies for Kenyans, alternative energy sources like solar power are providing sustainable options.Kagondu Njagi and Thomson Reuters Foundation  · Thomson Reuters Foundation trust.org 30 Jul 2020The one factor that could determine whether you keep or lose your job during a recessionData from the IMF has shown that in 2008 recession and today's pandemic-related recession, teleworkable occupations have proved to be more secure.Ippei Shibata · IMF Blog 30 Jul 2020How COVID has revealed the need for a rethink in urban planningTolullah Oni · Project Syndicate 30 Jul 2020Coronavirus: why can't some people shake off the fatigue?Frances Williams · The Conversation 30 Jul 2020Could this COVID-19 ‘health passport’ be the future of travel and events?Douglas Broom 30 Jul 20206 months on from declaring ‘a public health emergency’, WHO says COVID-19’s future is up to usCharlotte  Edmond  30 Jul 2020Subscribe for updatesA weekly update of what’s on the Global AgendaFollow UsAboutOur MissionLeadership and GovernanceThe Davos ManifestoOur Members and PartnersGlobalization 4.0The Fourth Industrial RevolutionCommunitiesCentre for the Fourth Industrial RevolutionOur ImpactHistoryCentre for CybersecurityKlaus SchwabMediaPicturesStrategic IntelligenceCareersContact UsWorld Economic Forum LLCCode of ConductWorld Economic Forum Privacy Policy SustainabilityMediaNewsAccreditationSubscribe to our newsMembers & PartnersMember login to TopLinkStrategic Partners' areaPartner Institutes' areaGlobal sitesCentre for the Fourth Industrial RevolutionOpen ForumGlobal ShapersSchwab Foundation for Social EntrepreneurshipStrategic IntelligenceGlobal RisksENES FR 中文 日本語          © 2020 World Economic Forum        Privacy Policy & Terms of Service","Thu, 30 Jul 2020 08:36:24 GMT"

Here's why that staggering loss of life can't be ignoredBy Holly Yan, CNNUpdated 4:10 PM ET, Wed July 29, 2020 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.JUST WATCHEDCalifornia reports highest number of single-day Covid-19 deathsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCalifornia reports highest number of single-day Covid-19 deaths 02:23 (CNN)If two large planes crashed every day in the US, killing everyone on board, the nation would be despondent. If the US suffered a loss of life on the scale of the 9/11 attacks -- 50 times over -- the tragedy would be incomprehensible. But that's how many lives coronavirus has claimed in the US since this pandemic started just six months ago. More than 150,000 people have died since the first known US death in February. That means every day, an average of more than 850 Americans have died from Covid-19.It's easy to grow numb or turn a blind eye to the losses. But there are several reasons why these numbers shouldn't be ignored -- and several ways to turn the tide around.Read More0.05% will quickly growSo far, about 0.05% of the US population has died from the novel coronavirus. That might sound like a tiny number. But we still have a long way to go before reaching herd immunity.Herd immunity generally happens when 70% to 90% of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease -- either because people have been infected and recovered, or because they've been vaccinated.Why herd immunity might not even happen with Covid-19But a vaccine might not be publicly available for several more months. And only about 13% of the US population has been infected with Covid-19 as of Tuesday -- meaning many more infections (and deaths) will likely follow before herd immunity.In fact, the US death toll is expected to reach 208,255 by November 1, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. At this rate, the US will likely endure 300,000 deaths by the end of this year, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University School of Medicine.Covid-19 is already a leading cause of death in some placesA disease that didn't even exist one year ago is now one of the leading causes of death in parts of the US. A 9-year-old who died of coronavirus had no known underlying health issues, family says""In many states, like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Covid-19 once again is the single leading daily cause of death,"" Hotez said Tuesday.Covid-19 is also one of the top killers in Los Angeles County, behind coronary heart disease, county health director Barbara Ferrer said.""It's killing more people than Alzheimer's disease, other kinds of heart disease, stroke, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),"" Ferrer said.Nationwide, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't rank leading causes of deaths until the end of the year so it can analyze a full year's worth of data. But last week, CDC statisticians told CNN they expect Covid-19 will rank in the top 10.Young survivors of Covid-19 describe long-term consequencesThe 150,000 death toll from seven months of Covid-19 has already surpassed the death tolls from other conditions for an entire year -- including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and the flu. In 2018 -- the latest year for which CDC cause-of-death data are available --  147,810 people died from strokes, 122,019 from Alzheimer's disease, 84,946 from diabetes, and 59,120 from flu and pneumonia. But even if you or your loved ones survive after catching Covid-19, long-term consequences could fester. ""Remember, it's not just the deaths. It's this terrible, disabling ... long-lasting disabilities to the lung, to the vascular system, to the heart, to the brain,"" Hotez said. ""We're seeing long-term cognitive deficits. This is a terrible illness.""It could happen to any of your loved onesCountless families have lost relatives far earlier than they imagined -- including young people with no pre-existing conditions. JUST WATCHEDFamily spoke to dad on phone for 30 hours before he died from Covid-19ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFamily spoke to dad on phone for 30 hours before he died from Covid-19 02:18But with the highly infectious nature of this virus, many loved ones have been forced to say their final goodbyes by cell phone call or video chat. Joe Lewinger was 42 and healthy before he caught Covid-19, his wife Maura said. But Joe's condition deteriorated rapidly, and Maura asked a doctor to connect them via FaceTime so she could have a final moment with her husband. Soon afterward, the doctor said Joe's pulse was gone.""I played our wedding song for him,"" Maura said. ""And then that was it.""Nicole Buchanan didn't even get to say goodbye to her husband. Covid-19: What we know now about this new diseaseConrad Buchanan, a 39-year-old DJ, had been repeatedly denied a Covid-19 test because he was young and had no underlying health issues, his wife said. Eventually, Conrad's condition got so bad that Nicole dropped him off at a hospital entrance and went to park the car. That was the last time she saw her husband.""I walked up to the doors. The hospital's on lockdown. They wouldn't let anybody in after that,"" she said. ""I never got to say, 'I love you.'""'We don't have to go through this'The good news: Now that scientists know more about how this virus spreads, many future deaths can be averted even without a vaccine. But that requires personal responsibility.Top health officials keep stressing the same safety measures that often get ignored: stay at least 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently, and wear a face mask.How these states got Covid-19 under control -- and what other states can learn from themAbout ‭45,447 lives could be saved between July and November if 95% of Americans wore face masks in public, the IHME researchers said. If everyone wore masks, that would drive down the projected death toll from 208,255 down to 162,808.But at this rate, the US is still likely to suffer a total of 200,000 deaths by this fall, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.""Of course, all of this is completely unnecessary. We don't have to go through this,"" Jha said.

The vaccine provided a robust immune response as demonstrated by ""neutralizing antibodies,"" successfully preventing subsequent infection and providing complete or near-complete protection in the lungs from the virus in non-human primates, the company said. Based on the strength of the data, a Phase 1/2a first-in-human clinical trial of the vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2.S, in healthy volunteers, has now commenced in the United States and Belgium, the company said. Discussions are underway with partners with the objective to start a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of the single vaccine dose versus placebo in September, pending the interim data of the Phase 1 and 2 trials and approval of regulators, Johnson & Johnson said.Read NextRead Next AMD stock surges to record after outlook contrasts with Intel’s ‘faceplant’Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s stock surges to fresh records Wednesday after the chip company’s strong second quarter and outlook signals a sea change in the semiconductor market following Intel Corp.’s announced delays of next-generation chips last week.More On MarketWatchBarron's: Kodak Stock Is Soaring.

The UK imposed a 14-day isolation on holidaymakers returning from Spain after infection rates spiked there, prompting the UK’s biggest tour operator to cancel all holidays to that country.

Here's why After recording its first cases since April, Viet Nam closed the tourist hotspot of Da Nang to tourists and evacuated 80,000 tourists from the city.Now, a new health passport app promises to restore confidence to the travel industry, which has been badly hit by the pandemic. Global tourism shrank by 97% in April, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization.A possible solutionCovidPass is the brainchild of one of the World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders, Mustapha Mokass. It also involves other YGLs across 5 continents, including Muna AbuSulayman and Peggy Liu. CovidPass uses blockchain technology to store encrypted data from individual blood tests, allowing users to prove that they have tested negative for COVID-19. Unlike contact tracing apps, CovidPass will not track users’ movements. Non-mandatory contact tracing apps have met with only limited success so far due to privacy concerns.Germany, regarded as one of the most successful nations in rolling out a voluntary app, currently has only 16 million users out of 83 million citizens. Experts say at least half the population needs to use a contact tracing app to make it effective in fighting the virus.Meanwhile, governments are faced with a variety of different testing regimes to validate the health of travellers. “This isn’t enough to reassure tourists or health authorities"", says Mokass. Mokass hopes his app, which is launching in September, will become a standardized solution for airlines, airports and border agencies, and eliminate quarantine for healthy travellers. CovidPass could also allow hotels, cinemas, theatres, sporting and concert venues to reopen safely.Another possible use would be to help restart the worldwide conference and exhibition industry, which has contracted by 60%, at a cost of $180 billion in lost revenues and impacting 1.9 million jobs, according to the industry’s global association, UFI.CovidPass commits to mandatory carbon offsetting for each flight passenger, to preserve the environmental benefits of reduced air travel during the crisis.coronavirus, health, COVID19, pandemicWhat is the World Economic Forum doing to manage emerging risks from COVID-19?The first global pandemic in more than 100 years, COVID-19 has spread throughout the world at an unprecedented speed. At the time of writing, 4.5 million cases have been confirmed and more than 300,000 people have died due to the virus.As countries seek to recover, some of the more long-term economic, business, environmental, societal and technological challenges and opportunities are just beginning to become visible.To help all stakeholders – communities, governments, businesses and individuals understand the emerging risks and follow-on effects generated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Marsh and McLennan and Zurich Insurance Group, has launched its COVID-19 Risks Outlook: A Preliminary Mapping and its Implications - a companion for decision-makers, building on the Forum’s annual Global Risks Report.              The report reveals that the economic impact of COVID-19 is dominating companies’ risks perceptions.            Companies are invited to join the Forum’s work to help manage the identified emerging risks of COVID-19 across industries to shape a better future.

Justice provides update on outbreak at Princeton nursing home facilityCOVID-19 UPDATE: Gov. Justice provides update on outbreak at Princeton nursing home facility7/29/2020​​Page Content​CHARLESTON,      WV – Gov. Jim Justice joined West Virginia health leaders and      other officials today for his latest daily press briefing regarding the      State’s COVID-19 response.PRINCETON      NURSING HOME OUTBREAK UPDATE      During Wednesday’s briefing, Gov. Justice provided an update on the      recent outbreak of COVID-19 cases identified at Princeton Health Care      Center – a long-term care facility in Mercer County.      Gov. Justice announced Wednesday that there are now a total of 42 active      cases at the facility, an increase of 11 cases since his previous      briefing Monday.      As of Wednesday afternoon, three deaths had been recorded as a result of      this outbreak.      “I’ve said over and over, this thing is a killer and it can move      quickly,” Gov. Justice said. “We can’t drop our guard. We have to stay on      top of this.      “As phenomenal as you have been, West Virginia, we still have real risk.”      The Governor reported that on-site testing is happening today and the      West Virginia National Guard is also providing PPE training to staff.      “When we first were notified, we ran everybody straight to fire,” Gov.      Justice said. “We tested everybody there. Now we are going back and      retesting.” Click images to view photo albumGov. Justice also announced that he has      directed the DHHR to investigate how this outbreak occurred and to do      everything possible to limit the risk of similar occurrences at similar      facilities moving forward.      “The evidence is, as we have completed contact tracing and looked at the      source of the outbreak in the Princeton nursing home, that it came in      from Myrtle Beach,” DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch said. “It’s certainly a      concern.      “As everyone will recall, this disease started in West Virginia very      slowly and only in a couple of settings,” Crouch continued. “We put a      focus on our nursing homes to make sure we didn’t have broad spread      there. The Governor tackled that head-on and we really tamped that down.”      West Virginia was the first state in the nation to order the full testing      of all residents and employees at each of the state’s nursing homes and assisted living      facilities.      “Unfortunately, where we are now is that a broad range of settings and      communities have had outbreaks,” Crouch said. “The Governor is right on      target in terms of our weapon, our defense in fighting this pandemic is      to wear a face covering.      “Please be considerate,” Crouch continued. “Make sure that you protect      yourself, your families, and others by wearing a face covering.” COVID-19 CASE      NUMBERS UPDATE      As of Wednesday afternoon, the total number of active COVID-19 cases in      West Virginia had dropped to 1,625.      View more COVID-19 data at Coronavirus.wv.gov.Kanawha County now has 252 active cases – down from 266      on Monday, but still the highest total for any county in the state.      Monongalia County now has 127 active cases – down from 177 on Monday. ACTIVE CHURCH      OUTBREAKS IN SIX COUNTIES      Additionally Wednesday, Gov. Justice announced that previous      church-related outbreaks in Raleigh and Wood counties are no longer      considered active at this time. However, additional church-related      outbreaks remain active in six counties across West Virginia, including      Boone, Grant, Kanawha, Logan, Mason, and Taylor counties.      These outbreaks account for about 131 total cases combined – down from      137 such cases on Monday.      “I again want to strongly encourage all West Virginians, especially when      in church settings, to follow the guidelines and use every other pew,      maintain social distancing, and please wear face coverings,” Gov. Justice      said. FREE COVID-19      TESTING: GILMER, MARION & HAMPSHIRE COUNTIES      Gov. Justice also updated the schedule of upcoming free community      COVID-19 testing events taking place over the      next two weeks at various dates and times in Gilmer, Marion, and      Hampshire counties.      The effort is part of a plan to provide free optional testing to all      residents in several counties that are experiencing higher rates of      COVID-19 transmission. It targets residents who have struggled to be seen      by a physician or do not have insurance to pay for testing. However,      other residents, including those who are asymptomatic are welcome to be      tested.

JUSTICE      DIRECTS OFFICIALS TO FIND LONG-TERM SOLUTION FOR CITY OF GARY WATER      SYSTEM      Gov. Justice took time out of his briefing to announce that, as of early      Wednesday morning, the City of Gary’s water system had been fixed and      water service had been restored.       However, the Governor added that the city is still under a boil water      advisory for seven days.      Residents can obtain drinking water at Gary City Hall and Rock Hill      Baptist Church in Gary.      On Tuesday, at the direction of Gov. Justice, State officials replenished      the water supply in Gary, delivering thousands more gallons of drinking      water – including a 5,500-gallon water tanker from the West Virginia      Division of Highways, 500 gallons stored in water trailers from the West      Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and three pallets,      stacked with additional cases of water – to ensure that all residents      impacted by the ongoing issue have access to all the clean water they      need.Click here to read      more      However, Gov. Justice said that, under his watch, the State’s efforts to      assist the City of Gary are far from over.      “I’ve dispatched engineers and additional engineers, and additional staff      members from the West Virginia Water Development Authority and the Public      Service Commission of West Virginia to meet with the City of Gary, the      mayor, and other leaders to come up with a long-term solution to this      problem beyond just delivering water,” Gov. Justice said Wednesday.      The outage began when the main pump serving the City of Gary water system      abruptly stopped working last week, leaving approximately 500 customers      without water service. Engineers who evaluated the system determined that      the pump was beyond repair and that a new, custom-made pump would need to      be purchased and installed because the backup pumps were also not      working.      Upon learning of the urgent situation last week, Gov. Justice immediately      took action, ordering the West Virginia National Guard and the West      Virginia Emergency Management Division to provide all necessary resources      to the City of Gary. Acting upon this order, WVEMD ordered an M149 water      trailer from the WVNG. The WVNG delivered the trailer, containing 400      gallons of potable water, to Gary City Hall. SMALL BUSINESS      GRANT APPLICATIONS      Also on Wednesday, Gov. Justice offered a reminder that applications are      available for small businesses seeking to      receive funding through the Governor’s West Virginia CARES Act Small      Business Grant Program, announcing that funds have begun being      distributed.      “Money starting going out today,” Gov. Justice said. “We're pushing      just as hard as we possibly can to keep pumping out more and more money.”      The initiative will provide $150 million of West Virginia’s CARES Act      funding to qualifying businesses across the state. Any West      Virginia-based small business, in existence on March 1, 2020, with 1-35      employees, is able to apply for up to $5,000 in grant funding.      Businesses planning to apply must first be registered as a vendor with      the State to be eligible. Guidelines for the grants and instructions on      how to apply are available at Grants.wv.gov.      The application will remain open until Sept. 30, 2020. CITIES/COUNTIES      GRANT FUNDING: $59.4 MILLION HAS NOW BEEN AWARDED      Also today, Gov. Justice provided an update on cities and counties      throughout West Virginia applying for funds through the federal CARES      Act, reporting that more than $59.4 million has now been awarded all      across the state.      A new web portal is now available for city and county government      officials to apply for this grant funding, at grants.wv.gov. Interested parties can      also call the helpline: 1-833-94-GRANT.      Each of the recipients of CARES Act funding, along with grant amounts,      are now available to view through the COVID-19      transparency web portal provided by West      Virginia State Auditor’s Office. WEST VIRGINIA      STRONG SUMMER FOOD ASSISTANCE MAP      Also, Gov. Justice reminded West Virginians that an interactive      free-feeding location map, designed to help connect citizens in need to      food resources across the state, is available online.Click here to view      the map      More than 696 free-feeding locations have now been made available      through a multi-agency effort between the West Virginia National Guard,      the West Virginia Department of Education, the West Virginia Bureau of      Senior Services, the West Virginia Voluntary Organizations Active in      Disaster (WV VOAD), and the United Way.      If food distribution locations aren't available in some communities,      individuals are encouraged to call 211 for further assistance. WEST VIRGINIANS      URGED TO PARTICIPATE IN CENSUS      Once more today, Gov. Justice asked all West Virginians to participate in      the 2020 United States Census.      Every West Virginian who does not respond to the Census represents a loss      of $20,000 in federal funds over the next 10 years for the state and its      local communities. The funds can go toward things like healthcare,      education, infrastructure, school lunch programs, and more.      Be counted in minutes: 2020census.gov.

Regulatory Focus™ > News Articles > 2020 > 7 > FDA issues at-home and OTC COVID-19 testing templateFDA issues at-home and OTC COVID-19 testing templatePosted 29 July 2020 | By Kari Oakes       Developers of COVID-19 diagnostic tests designed for at-home and over-the-counter use have a new template they can use to submit emergency use authorization (EUA) requests to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For at-home testing, the template includes recommendations for developers in the scenario where samples are collected, analyzed, and results returned without the sample being sent to a laboratory for analysis. Additional validation recommendations are provided in the template for tests available without a prescription. Providing the template, said FDA, is a step toward having tests available during the pandemic that can be performed entirely outside of a clinical setting; in addition to home-based testing, schools and workplaces may benefit from these types of tests. “The FDA continues to help facilitate innovation in test development, thereby enhancing Americans’ access to COVID-19 tests,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, MD. “The recommendations provided today are intended to help get tests to market that are simple enough to use at home, similar to a pregnancy test.” The template includes recommended sensitivity and specificity thresholds for these types of tests. FDA notes that though the recommended sensitivity is lower than lab-based tests that have received EUAs, “the tremendous benefits of broader access to simple and fast testing options generally outweighs this risk.” The recommended specimens specified in the template are respiratory secretions or saliva; FDA requests that developers contemplating other specimen sources (such as blood or stool) contact the Center for Devices and Radiologic Health to work out a validation strategy. The template also asks the develop to specify the intended measurand, which would either be the specific nucleic acid sequences from the SARS-CoV-2 genome or specific antigens from the virus. Developers will be asked to describe the planned reporting method, including a mobile smartphone app or website access. However, FDA says it intends to be flexible in considering novel or innovative reporting methods. Recommendations in the template for interpretation of results take into account that a lay person may be reading the results, so “results that are displayed to the user should be simple and easy to interpret.” Developers should also explain if, and how, they plan to report results to local health authorities, and whether de-identified information will be transmitted to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “We hope that with the innovation we’ve seen in test development, we could see tests that you could buy at a drug store, swab your nose or collect saliva, run the test, and receive results within minutes at home, once these tests become available,” said Hahn. “These types of tests will be a game changer in our fight against COVID-19 and will be crucial as the nation looks toward reopening.” FDA    Tags: coronavirus, FDA, USRegulatory NewsStory ThumbnailFDA issues at-home and OTC COVID-19 testing template                                            29 July 2020                                        By                                            Kari Oakes                                         Read MoreStory ThumbnailFDA revises draft PLLR guidance                                            29 July 2020                                        By                                            Michael Mezher                                         Read MoreStory ThumbnailFDA addresses endotoxin levels in investigational cancer treatments                                            29 July 2020                                        By                                            Kari Oakes                                         Read MoreView All NewsRegulatory Focus newslettersAll the biggest regulatory news and happenings.SubscribeSupport Regulatory Focus™ in these crucial timesDonate Now SupportRegulatory Focus™Donate NowRegulatory Focus™ is doing essential, non-biased journalism during this unprecedented time.

But they aren’t all necessarily Champaign County residents, since local hospitals also care for patients from other counties.Both Carle and OSF have surge plans in place should the number of COVID-19 patients needing hospital care begin to grow beyond the resources available. The plans have been in place since before Illinois had reached 500 cases statewide.“We do have an emergency operations plan for each hospital that contains a surge plan,” Rogers said. “It will allow us to increase our general and/or ICU beds as needed, pending the availability of staff. Hospitals have been running through those scenarios with leaders, mission partners and medical staff.”Rogers also said OSF hospitals have the ability to redeploy personnel and resources, such as ventilators and personal protective equipment, throughout its system as needed.Data from the Illinois Department of Public Health shows that in Region 6, which includes East Central Illinois counties, 66 percent of the total 162 intensive-care beds and 13 percent of the 290 ventilators are in use.FacebookTwitterWhatsAppSMSEmailPrintSaveDeb PresseyReporterDebra Pressey is a reporter covering health care at The News-Gazette.

""We've continued to have a high volume of our general population as well as our COVID population, and this just assured we had that extra capacity should we need it.""Guy said the possibility of opening part of the expansion early was brought up early on in the pandemic, but it didn't seem possible. Then, six weeks ago, the construction team said they thought they could hit the mark.""It was a lot of effort,"" Guy said. ""We're not completely finished with it. Certainly, now artwork's up, you know – the finishing touches, those things – but our goal was to make sure we had it safe for patients.""The hospital got approval from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration to open the rooms on July 24. According to BayCare, up to 30 neurological and orthopedic patients can be transferred into the tower's fifth floor to create space for COVID-19 patients in the main hospital, if needed. Other parts of the $126 million project are still works in progress, but a second floor is expected to open this week. Guy said that can also be used to increase capacity.""It's incredibly rewarding. I have been so amazed at the communication and collaboration this has taken. So, we are thrilled to be able to have this capacity for our community. Our mission is to provide for the health care needs of this community, and that's exactly why we pushed this effort – so we would be ready,"" Guy said.The expansion has been in the works for two years. Once finished, it will include three patient floors with 30 beds each, a bridge that will connect the main hospital to St. Joseph's Women's Hospital, and a two-story lobby with a drive-up front entrance. The entire project is expected to wrap up in early September.

The new ICU, on the second floor of the patient tower, will provide 14 fully equipped and staffed ICU beds.“Though it is our sincere hope that the number of COVID inpatients will soon start to decline, all indications are that it will continue to rise,” Hyatt said. “We are grateful to be able to scale up to meet the growing needs of our patients during this pandemic.”In the event the 14 new beds fill as well, he said hospital staff have identified other areas that can be converted into ICU beds. In earlier talks about possible expansions, Self Chief Medical Officer Dr. Matt Logan said the hospital has enough ventilators to maintain an expanded ICU.All procedures and policies that apply for the regular ICU also apply to the new site. Non-COVID-19 patients in critical care areas have visitation limited to one visitor per day between 1-3 p.m. Security must call the critical care unit before sending a visitor there, to ensure visitation is permitted.In terms of staffing, Hyatt said a number of Self employees volunteered to be reassigned to the additional ICU unit, along with some contract clinicians from outside Self. The additional 14 beds will be fully staffed. Hyatt said Self’s staff members are grateful to have such skilled, dedicated and compassionate team members.“As is the case with every hospital in the US, clinical staffing continues to be one of our biggest challenges,” he said. “Even before the pandemic, there was a nationwide shortage of nurses, and that situation is even more challenging now.”In early July, Self CEO Jim Pfeiffer and Logan went before Greenwood County Council and said that week saw the hospital dealing with its highest inpatient care numbers to that point. They supported the council passing an ordinance requiring people to wear masks. The ordinance did not pass, and in its place County Council approved a resolution urging — but not requiring — residents to wear facial coverings.Self’s command center monitors incoming information about COVID-19 and collaborates with state and county officials to review the latest data. While Self’s ICU has filled in the past, Pfeiffer made clear that staff work constantly to determine when patients can safely be transferred to other parts of the hospital for specific treatment.Pfeiffer previously explained that Self’s surge plan would trigger if the ICU was at full capacity and there was no possibility of safely moving patients to other areas of the hospital in the near future. While the hospital’s inpatient numbers and ICU occupancy fluctuate often, he said staff closely monitor these factors when making decisions.While Greenwood County has seen a decline in new cases in recent weeks that seems to correspond with the city’s mask ordinance, neighboring counties also served by Self have not seen that decline. Also, new case totals include those with mild or no symptoms and don’t necessarily correspond with hospitalizations.Contact staff writer Damian Dominguez at 864-634-7548 or follow on Twitter @IJDDOMINGUEZ.FacebookTwitterWhatsAppSMSEmailPrintSaveCOVID-19                                LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                            New Update3 hrs ago                            Bateman hired as interim Greenwood County economic development directorJames Bateman has been hired as interim Greenwood County economic development director. 9 hrs ago                            Self expands ICU to handle growing COVID-19 patient numbersSelf Regional Medical Center’s intensive care unit is full, so on Tuesday, the staff expanded the ICU to handle the growing number of COVID-19 patients.

This 80-year-old woman laughed it all offBy Anna Sturla, CNNUpdated 2:59 PM ET, Wed July 29, 2020 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Eighty-year-old New Yorker Judith Hunt went to the hospital on January 31 after falling and breaking a femur and hip.She left Manhattan's Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital in early July -- after battling an aneurysm, sepsis, abdominal and heart surgeries and Covid-19, she and her doctors told CNN.""It was hysterically funny, in a way,"" Hunt said of the experience. ""It was like every time I turned around, something new came up. That's why I started laughing at it. Because it was like, when do we get leprosy? When is the rain of frogs?""Hunt tested positive for the coronavirus in March, according to Dr. Gabriele DiLuozzo, director of aortic surgery for the hospital. At one point, Hunt was intubated and put on a respirator. She was also initially given doses hydroxychloroquine, which worsened her heart condition and led to a heart attack, Dr. DiLuozzo said.After ""enormous collaboration"" between multiple teams of physicians, physical therapists and other health care workers, Hunt was able to walk out of the hospital on her own. However, Dr. DiLuozzo credits her ""remarkable recovery"" at least in part to her spirit and attitude toward life.Read More""I spoke with the nurses,"" Dr. DiLuozzo said. ""I said if there was a way I could extract her genes, I would try somehow to put them in my bloodstream, because this woman is indestructible.""Hunt said she realized early on that her chances were ""not good."" She decided to accept her possible death with her indomitable sense of humor.""Hell, at one point I died for two minutes,"" Hunt said. ""And did I get the white light? No. It's like getting your tonsils out, and no ice cream or jello.""They have been married 46 years and just overcame Covid-19, cancer and chemo togetherHunt can talk at length about the ""magnificent"" doctors, nurses, aides and room cleaners who took care of her.""They gave me such hope for the human race that people like them existed,"" Hunt said.Dr. Malcolm Reid, chair of rehabilitation at Mount Sinai Morningside and Mount Sinai West, oversaw her physical recovery. ""Many patients just wouldn't have had the mental fortitude to stay the course,"" Dr. Reid said. ""Just to be in the hospital that long is draining.""This August, Hunt and two friends will be renting a room on Long Island's East Hampton.""I have no idea what's next,"" Hunt said.

But now I do not have to because there is solar lighting in my kitchen,"" says one farm worker.When Lucyline Wanja Silas installed a 12-volt solar power unit at her home to help her children study at night, little did she know it would become essential to her and her neighbours in Gakunga village, central Kenya, during the coronavirus pandemic.Wanja, a 48-year-old farm worker, said she had not made any money since the country's lockdown started in March, but the solar photovoltaic (PV) unit she purchased in January means she no longer needs to buy kerosene for lamplight.And she can also help others in her area who are without electricity, either because of faults on power lines around the country due to heavy rains since March or because they could not pay their bills after losing their jobs during the pandemic.""My neighbours who are experiencing blackouts now come to me so that I can charge their phones for them for a fee,"" she said, adding that they pay 20 to 50 Kenyan shillings ($0.19-0.46).""There is no money out there. I do not know what I could be using to buy kerosene if I had not installed this solar unit.""Have you read?            How to ensure schools and hospitals benefit from Africa's solar boom With extreme weather and the economic impact of COVID-19 plunging many Kenyans into darkness, alternative energy sources are increasingly important - even for families connected to the grid, said Pamela Mukami Njeru, a community health volunteer in the central Mt. Kenya region.One in four Kenyans - mostly in rural areas - do not have access to electricity. Those who do face high costs and frequent blackouts due to an unreliable supply.As cases of the novel coronavirus continue to climb in Kenya, the lack of reliable power can be a matter of life and death, said Njeru, whose work involves taking patients with urgent health problems to and from hospital.""Without a power source, families facing an emergency are not able to keep their mobile phones charged to call us. This is how having a solar unit which can supply power all day and night can save lives,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.In early May, Kenya suffered a nationwide blackout that lasted about six hours, and the following month, more than 20 counties lost electricity for about 10 hours.Bernard Ngugi, managing director of the Kenya Power and Lighting Company, told reporters in June that the blackouts were the result of work being done by the company to replace damaged power lines or to upgrade the network to connect new customers.              Lucyline Wanja Silas prepares a meal outside her kitchen in Gakunga village, central Kenya, using power from a solar PV unit she installed early this year.                          Image: THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION/Kagondu Njagi            Slow startWanja had hoped to be one of them. She applied for an electricity connection in 2016, but local officials said her application was turned down because she lived too far from the main road.Worried the kerosene lamps she used for lighting could cause a fire or the toxic fumes would harm her children's health, she decided to put some of her savings into buying a solar system.Now she has power through the blackouts, she saves the dollar a week she used to spend on kerosene and her children can study safely, she said.""Sometimes I would even take the tin lamp to use in the kitchen, leaving my children in darkness. But now I do not have to because there is solar lighting in my kitchen,"" Wanja said.If more Kenyans switched to solar, the move could also help curb climate change, according to a 2018 report by Stockholm Environment Institute Africa researchers.Replacing smoky fuels such as kerosene, wood and charcoal with solar energy could help reduce emissions in Kenya by 1.8 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, it said.In 2015, less than 1% of Kenya's electricity came from solar - with most generated from fossil fuels, hydropower and geothermal energy - but the country has the potential to push that up to more than 7% by 2030, the report added.The researchers linked the slow uptake of solar energy to high investment costs in recent years, noting that upfront costs involved in generating one kilowatt of energy from solar were more than three times as much as those for hydropower.""We have the solutions and we have the technologies. But the important thing is up-scaling these so that renewable energy generation can become cheaper in Africa,"" said Mbeo Ogeya, one of the report's authors.              Vendors carrying traditional medicine in jerrycans, stand outside a stall which has graffiti against the spread of the coronavirus disease within Kibera slums in Nairobi, Kenya.                          Image: REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya            Life supportStephen Nzioka, deputy director of renewable energy at Kenya's Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, said the costs of solar energy are falling.A report published in June by the International Renewable Energy Agency noted that the cost of utility-scale PV solar power dropped by more than 80% between 2010 and last year.""We are encouraging renewable energy technologies and (their) dissemination, but also combining mini-grids with solar PV systems,"" said Nzioka, adding that the government had removed import duty on solar products.Harriet Lamb, CEO of British climate charity Ashden, has called for investors, governments and philanthropic groups to create a $35-million fund to support community-based clean-energy businesses during the COVID-19 outbreak, as customers struggle to pay.""Off-grid solar offers a lifeline for around 470 million people, keeping lights on and equipment working in health facilities, small businesses and households,"" she said in a statement earlier this month.""But some clean energy businesses are vulnerable to collapse without support to see them through the pandemic.""Wanja said the weekly payments she makes on her solar unit work out at 55 Kenyan shillings a day.Yet, while the government is now easing the coronavirus lockdown, she still has no work - so even that small but essential cost is proving too much.""Much of my income comes from doing menial jobs, but now there are none because of COVID-19. I cannot afford to pay the daily fee.

The Way Forward on COVID-19: A Road Map to Reset the Nation’s Approach to the Pandemic calls on federal and state governments, businesses, academic medicine, and local communities to work together to implement a set of 11 evidence-based, short- and long-term actions to address critical testing and supply issues, mitigate the spread of the virus, and ameliorate the health disparities that have further exacerbated the pandemic for vulnerable populations, among other actions. “If the nation does not change its course — and soon — deaths in the United States could well be in the multiples of hundreds of thousands,” said David J. Skorton, MD, AAMC president and CEO. “The nation urgently needs a decisive, coordinated strategy to save lives, restore the U.S. economy, and return our lives to a sense of normalcy.” Based on AAMC experts’ understanding of the pandemic as doctors, scientists, and medical educators, the road map includes such immediate actions as ramping up production of testing reagents and tubes, personal protective equipment, and critical medications; increasing the availability of and turnaround time for testing; and establishing national standards for face coverings, stay-at-home orders, and reopening protocols.  The first three action items are urgent, AAMC leaders say. Six additional ones should be addressed immediately and two are longer-term actions. The following is a brief summary of all recommendations in the plan. Immediate actionsRemedy critical supply and drug shortages. Persistent shortages have marred the U.S. response to the pandemic from the outset. Therefore, the federal government should invoke the Defense Production Act or other powers to issue large contracts to companies producing critical medications, personal protective equipment, and testing supplies. In particular, the plan calls for the domestic production of testing supplies needed to conduct 2.3 million coronavirus tests per day. It further stipulates the need to manufacture enough supplies and equipment so that health care institutions can have a three-day supply on premises, a 14-day supply available within a two- to three-hour drive of the facility, and a 30-day supply warehoused within a geographic region. Increase availability and accessibility of testing. The road map recommends a goal of conducting 2.3 million tests per day and urges the Coronavirus Task Force — working with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and state public health departments — to create a web portal that would allow all laboratories to report shortages of critical testing supplies; assess and manage the supply chain for testing; and communicate supply chain issues with labs, vendors, and the general public. Establish national standards on face coverings. The standards should be grounded in scientific knowledge about the spread of the novel coronavirus and should govern local and state decisions about mandatory mask wearing, depending on the level of community spread in a particular area. Establish and enforce national criteria for local stay-at-home orders and reopening protocols. Those criteria should be based on the number of current and recent cases, the proportion of positive cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and local health care capacity. State and local governments should order and enforce mandatory stay-at-home orders and progressive reopenings guided by those criteria.Establish national criteria for K-12 school reopenings and convene a working group to study different approaches. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine have developed a road map for reopening schools, which could be used to guide educators and state and local officials.  Immediately expand health insurance through COBRA. As an estimated 10 million Americans have lost access to employer-based health insurance since the pandemic began, Congress should expand COBRA and at least partially subsidize premiums for that coverage. Begin planning now to prioritize distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Such planning should take into account the disproportionate impact of the virus on health care workers, essential workers, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. Address and resolve health care inequities. Because vulnerable populations are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, the federal government should develop a national, standardized data collection system that accurately captures race and ethnicity as a starting point for addressing health care inequities.Inform, educate, and engage the public. Conflicting messages about how to prevent, treat, and contain the coronavirus have led to widespread confusion among the American public. Therefore, any effort to reset the nation’s response should involve a concerted effort to educate the public. Academic medical center websites could be repositories for this expert information. On a national level, federal, state, and local public health agencies should work to send out daily updates about the virus and local conditions in the area.Longer-term actionsBroaden health insurance. The loss of employer-based insurance during the pandemic has created a second national health crisis. Therefore, policymakers should expand Medicaid in all 50 states, and for those not eligible for Medicaid, a federally subsidized insurance option should be made available to all individuals below a certain annual income. Strengthen the nation’s public health infrastructure. As the pandemic has made clear, the nation’s public health infrastructure is woefully underfunded. Therefore, the federal government should prioritize funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and municipalities should improve funding for state and local public health departments.“Currently, we have a lot of recommendations from many highly qualified people around the country, but we also have a patchwork of responses at the state and local levels,” Skorton says. “Our road map aggregates the actions that need to happen, adds some specific quantitative targets, and indicates where the responsibility for action lies. Stopping the pandemic is everyone’s responsibility.” New sectionGabrielle  Redford, Managing Editor New sectionSHARE:RelatedMore in Advocacy      Press Releases                AAMC Releases “The Way Forward on COVID-19: A Road Map to Reset the Nation’s Approach to…          July 29, 2020                  Advocacy                |                  Patient Care                |                  Coronavirus                |                  Health Equity                      Washington Highlights                President Signs Executive Orders to Lower Drug Prices          July 28, 2020                  Advocacy                |                  Patient Care                |                  Medicare                |                  Prescription Drugs                      Washington Highlights                AAMC Submits Comments on Medicaid Prescription Drug VBP Proposed Rule          July 24, 2020                  Advocacy                |                  Patient Care                |                  Medicaid                |                  Prescription Drugs                      Washington Highlights                Senate Committee Advances Bill Targeting Foreign Government Influence in Research          July 24, 2020                  Advocacy                |                  Research                |                  Congress                |                  Senate                      Washington Highlights                HHS Renews Public Health Emergency          July 24, 2020                  Advocacy                |                  HHS                |                  Coronavirus                      Washington Highlights                On the Agenda In Washington          July 24, 2020                  Advocacy                |                  Communications                |                  Capitol Hill                Receive weekly news and insights from the AAMC in your inbox.First Name:Last Name:Email:Find leadership jobs in academic medicineCareerConnect          For students & residents          Learn About Medical Schools Learn About the MCAT Exam Apply to Medical School Apply to Residency Finance Your EducationSocial Media          For members          Find Your Affinity GroupHost a Project Medical Education EventSocial Media           For the media          Press ReleasesIn-DepthPress ContactsSocial Media           Resources          StoreHelpContact UsAcademic MedicineMedEdPORTALJobs at AAMCSocial Media Association of    American Medical Colleges655 K Street, NW, Suite 100    Washington, DC, 20001-2399 Terms & ConditionsPrivacy StatementAccessibilitySocial Media© 2020 AAMC","Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:06:00 GMT"
Corruption and COVID-19 – IMF Blog - International Monetary Fund,https://blogs.imf.org/2020/07/28/corruption-and-covid-19/,"Corruption and COVID-19 – IMF Blog Skip to contentIMF HomepageAbout UsBloggers TwitterFacebookInstagramLinkedInYouTubeFlickr  Search for:HomeGlobal EconomyFinancial marketsGovernmentinclusive growthtechnologyEnvironmentHomeGlobal EconomyFinancial marketsGovernmentinclusive growthtechnologyEnvironmentSearch for: Previous Next (photo: Ingram Publishing/Newscom) Corruption and COVID-19 By Vitor Gaspar, Martin Mühleisen, and Rhoda Weeks-Brownعربي,  中文, Español, Français, 日本語, Português, Русский Corruption, the abuse of public office for private gain, is about more than wasted money: it erodes the social contract and corrodes the government’s ability to help grow the economy in a way that benefits all citizens. Corruption was a problem before the crisis, but the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the importance of  stronger governance  for three reasons.First, governments around the world are playing a bigger role in the economy to combat the pandemic and provide economic lifelines to people and firms. This expanded role is crucial but it also  increases opportunities for corruption. To help ensure the money and measures are helping the people who need it most, governments need timely and transparent reporting, ex-post audits and accountability procedures, and close cooperation with civil society and the private sector.Governments are playing a bigger role in the economy and this increases opportunities for corruption.Second, as public finances worsen, countries need to prevent tax evasion and the waste and loss of funds caused by  corruption in public spending.Third, crises test people’s trust in government and institutions, and ethical behavior becomes more salient when medical services are in such high demand. Evidence of  corruption  could undermine a country’s ability to respond effectively to the crisis, deepening the economic impact, and threatening a loss of political and social cohesion.During this crisis the IMF hasn’t taken its eye off the ball of our governance and anti-corruption work. Our message to all governments has been clear:  spend whatever you need but keep the receipts, because we don’t want accountability to be lost in the process.In our lending work, we have provided quick disbursements to meet urgent needs. At the same time, enhanced governance measures to  track COVID-19 related spending  have been part of the emergency financing for countries to fight the pandemic.Borrowing countries have committed to (i) undertake and publish independent ex-post audits of crisis-related spending and (ii) publish crisis-related procurement contracts on the government’s website, including identifying the companies awarded the contract and their beneficial owners. The IMF also ensured that emergency resources are subject to the IMF’s  Safeguards Assessment  policy.Long-term reform beyond the crisisGovernance safeguards for emergency assistance related to COVID-19 are part of a more comprehensive effort by the IMF to improve its member countries good governance and efforts to tackle corruption.The IMF has significantly increased its focus on governance and corruption over the last few years. We adopted in 2018 an enhanced  framework designed to make our work with countries more candid, evenhanded, and effective. This laid the foundation for our COVID-19 policy and lending response, where stronger governance matters even more.We recently assessed our progress in recent years and published the findings in a  staff analysis. Here are the key highlights:We speak more candidly and in-depth about governance issues with countries. Text mining analysis shows that we increased coverage of governance and corruption issues in our annual assessments of countries’ economic health and in our lending programs. Governance-related references more than doubled in staff reports in the 18 months after the IMF approved the framework, compared with 2017. In 2019, the IMF discussed governance with countries four times more than the average over the prior ten years. Just recently—for instance—our surveillance work has focused on central bank governance and operations in Liberia, financial sector oversight in Moldova, and the anti-corruption framework in Mexico. Fund staff are proposing more concrete governance and anti-corruption recommendations.IMF-supported lending programs include specific conditionality related to governance and anti-corruption reforms, with governance improvements now being a core objective of many programs.We have stepped up technical assistance and training to help countries strengthen governance and anti-corruption efforts. We aim to help countries improve governance in areas such as tax administration, expenditure oversight, fiscal transparency, financial sector oversight, anti-corruption institutions, and asset declarations for senior officials. This includes governance diagnostic missions to a dozen countries, comprising detailed analysis of governance weaknesses based on legal frameworks and proposing prioritized solutions.Moreover, so far, ten advanced economies—Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States—have participated in the voluntary assessment of their national frameworks to limit opportunities for transnational corruption. The purpose of the assessments, conducted by the IMF, is to determine the degree to which a country does two things: (1) criminalizes and prosecutes bribery of foreign public officials and (2) prevents foreign officials from concealing corrupt proceeds in its own financial system or domestic economy. The IMF strongly encourages member countries to volunteer for such coverage in its annual economic health checks.Curbing corruption requires government ownership of reforms, international cooperation, and a joint effort with civil society and the private sector. It also involves political will and the assiduous implementation of reforms over months and years.This crisis will sharpen our focus on governance in the years ahead because of the pandemic’s devastating effects and costs for people and economies. Countries can’t afford to lose precious resources at the best of times, and even less so during and after the pandemic. If ever there was a time for anti-corruption reforms, it is now.

The FDA reissued the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR Test EUA to expand use of the test to anyone, after the company provided scientific data showing the test’s ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a general, asymptomatic population. Additionally, the reissuance includes authorization for LabCorp to test pooled samples containing up to five individual swab specimens collected under observation. Sample pooling allows for fewer tests to be run overall, conserving resources and potentially allowing more samples to be evaluated quicker.“FDA’s authorization of the first diagnostic test to be used for anyone, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 or have other exposure risk factors, is a step toward the type of broad screening that may help enable the reopening of schools and workplaces,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “By authorizing another test for use with pooled samples, we also further help increase the possibility that patients may be able to receive results sooner, while also conserving vital testing supplies, which are under increased demand during the pandemic. Continuing to facilitate increased access to accurate and reliable tests for all Americans is critically important and the FDA continues to work around the clock with test developers to support this goal.”The FDA recognizes that organizations may want to conduct screening of asymptomatic people as part of a broader strategy to help ensure the safety of their employees, patients, students and others. Last month, the FDA posted updated templates with recommendations for test developers to demonstrate validation for a test to be authorized for screening of asymptomatic people, as well as for sample pooling. Last week, the FDA authorized the first COVID-19 test that could be used with pooled samples.The LabCorp test remains prescription-only and is authorized for human specimen collection either at home using the Pixel by LabCorp or other home sample collection kits authorized for use with LabCorp’s test, or by a health care provider. However, only health care provider-collected samples may be pooled at this time. Additionally, the data reviewed by the FDA demonstrated that the test is as accurate in the broader asymptomatic population as it is among people suspected to have COVID-19.The LabCorp test was originally issued an EUA on March 16 for use only in people suspected of being ill with COVID-19 by their health care provider and for testing of individual specimens without sample pooling. Until now, molecular diagnostic tests have generally been authorized for people suspected of having COVID-19 by their health care provider, which has allowed asymptomatic people to be tested, when warranted, at the discretion of the health care provider. Today’s authorization eliminates the need for a provider to consider risk factors such as exposure or community spread when prescribing this test. The FDA continues to work with test developers to expand access to COVID-19 testing.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.###InquiriesMedia: Jim McKinney 240-328-7305          Consumer: 888-INFO-FDARelated InformationRelated InformationFrequently Asked Questions regarding tests for screening of asymptomatic individualsFDA Statement regarding facilitation of diagnostic test availability for asymptomatic testing and sample poolingContent current as of:07/24/2020Regulated Product(s)Medical DevicesHealth Topic(s)Infectious DiseaseCoronavirusFollow FDA Follow @US_FDA on Twitter Follow FDA on Facebook  Follow @FDAmedia on Twitter   More Press Announcements                                        Press Announcements                       Footer LinksFDA ArchiveAbout FDAAccessibilityVisitor Information Website Policies / PrivacyNo FEAR ActFOIAHHS.govUSA.govContact FDAFollow FDA on FacebookFollow FDA on TwitterView FDA videos on YouTubeSubscribe to FDA RSS feedsFDA Homepage Contact Number      1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)    Back to Top","Sat, 25 Jul 2020 00:50:04 GMT"

The goal is to ensure that laws protect the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities and that they adhere to international human rights standards.The new Lab (at www.COVIDLawLab.org) is a joint project of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. Well-designed laws can help build strong health systems; evaluate and approve safe and effective drugs and vaccines; and enforce actions to create healthier and safer public spaces and workplaces. Critically, they are key to effective implementation of the WHO International Health Regulations: surveillance; infection prevention and control; management of travel and trade; and implementation of measures to maintain essential health services. “Laws and policies that are grounded in science, evidence and human rights can enable people to access health services, protect themselves from COVID-19 and live free from stigma, discrimination and violence,” says Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “The COVID-19 Law Lab is an important tool for sharing good practices on laws and policies.”The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a vast increase in urgent legislative action to control and reduce the pandemic. “Strong legal frameworks are critical for national COVID-19 responses,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Laws that impact health often fall outside the health sector. As health is global, legal frameworks should be aligned with international commitments to respond to current and emerging public health risks. A strong foundation of law for health is more important now than ever before.”However, laws that are poorly designed, implemented, or enforced can harm marginalized populations, entrench stigma and discrimination, and hinder efforts to end the pandemic.“Harmful laws can exacerbate stigma and discrimination, infringe on people’s rights and undermine public health responses,” according to Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “To ensure responses to the pandemic are effective, humane and sustainable, governments must use the law as a tool to uphold the human rights and dignity of people affected by COVID-19.”The COVID-19 Law Lab is a database of laws that countries have implemented in response to the pandemic. It includes state of emergency declarations, quarantine measures, disease surveillance, legal measures relating to mask-wearing, social distancing, and access to medication and vaccines. The database will continue to grow as more countries and themes are added. It will also feature research on different legal frameworks for COVID-19. These analyses will focus on the human rights impacts of public health laws and help countries identify best practices to guide their immediate responses to COVID-19 and socioeconomic recovery efforts once the pandemic is under control. It builds off the work of the UHC Legal Solutions Network, which was established to help countries achieve universal health coverage through the implementation of rights-based legal frameworks. “We need to track and evaluate how laws and policies are being used during the Pandemic to understand what works,” said Dr. Matthew M. Kavanagh, faculty in Georgetown University’s Department of International Health. Katie Gottschalk, Executive Director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center added, “We must learn lessons from the early stage of pandemic policies to implement the most effective laws going forward – the COVID-19 Law Lab allows us to do just that.”About UNDPUNDP is the leading United Nations organization fighting to end the injustice of poverty, inequality, and climate change.

The Quest test is the first COVID-19 diagnostic test to be authorized for use with pooled samples.Sample pooling is an important public health tool because it allows for more people to be tested quickly using fewer testing resources. Sample pooling does this by allowing multiple people – in this case four individuals – to be tested at once. The samples collected from these four individuals are then tested in a pool or “batch” using one test, rather than running each individual sample on its own test. If the pool is positive, it means that one or more of the individuals tested in that pool may be infected, so each of the samples in that pool are tested again individually. Because the samples are pooled, it is expected that fewer tests are run overall, meaning fewer testing supplies are used and more tests can be run at the same time allowing patients to receive their results more quickly in most cases. This testing strategy is most efficient in areas with low prevalence, meaning most results are expected to be negative.“This EUA for sample pooling is an important step forward in getting more COVID-19 tests to more Americans more quickly while preserving testing supplies,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Sample pooling becomes especially important as infection rates decline and we begin testing larger portions of the population.”While there is a concern that combining samples may make it more difficult to detect positives, since pooling in the laboratory dilutes any viral material present in the samples, Quest’s validation data demonstrates that its test correctly identified all of the pooled samples that contained a positive sample. It is important to note that the Quest test, initially authorized on March 17, 2020, remains authorized to test individual samples collected by their health care provider from people with suspected COVID-19 infection. The test is also still authorized for use with individual nasal swab specimens that are self-collected at home or in a health care setting using an authorized home-collection kit when determined to be appropriate by a health care provider.The FDA continues to work with a number of diagnostic test developers to facilitate new approaches and get additional tests to more Americans more quickly.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.###InquiriesMedia: Emma Spaulding 240-753-3903          Consumer: 888-INFO-FDARelated InformationRelated InformationFDA Statement: Facilitating Diagnostic Test Availability for Asymptomatic Testing and Sample PoolingCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Emergency Use Authorizations for In Vitro DiagnosticsContent current as of:07/18/2020Regulated Product(s)Medical DevicesHealth Topic(s)Infectious DiseaseCoronavirusFollow FDA Follow @US_FDA on Twitter Follow FDA on Facebook  Follow @FDAmedia on Twitter   More Press Announcements                                        Press Announcements                       Footer LinksFDA ArchiveAbout FDAAccessibilityVisitor Information Website Policies / PrivacyNo FEAR ActFOIAHHS.govUSA.govContact FDAFollow FDA on FacebookFollow FDA on TwitterView FDA videos on YouTubeSubscribe to FDA RSS feedsFDA Homepage Contact Number      1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332)    Back to Top","Sat, 18 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT"

The black area in the image is extracellular space between the cells. Image captured at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility (IRF) in Fort Detrick, Maryland. NIAIDAn investigational vaccine, mRNA-1273, designed to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was generally well tolerated and prompted neutralizing antibody activity in healthy adults, according to interim results published online today in The New England Journal of Medicine. The ongoing Phase 1 trial is supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. The experimental vaccine is being co-developed by researchers at NIAID and at Moderna, Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Manufactured by Moderna, mRNA-1273 is designed to induce neutralizing antibodies directed at a portion of the coronavirus “spike” protein, which the virus uses to bind to and enter human cells.The trial was led by Lisa A. Jackson, M.D., MPH, of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, where the first participant received the candidate vaccine on March 16. This interim report details the initial findings from the first 45 participants ages 18 to 55 years enrolled at the study sites in Seattle and at Emory University in Atlanta. Three groups of 15 participants received two intramuscular injections, 28 days apart, of either 25, 100 or 250 micrograms (mcg) of the investigational vaccine. All the participants received one injection; 42 received both scheduled injections.In April, the trial was expanded to enroll adults older than age 55 years; it now has 120 participants. However, the newly published results cover the 18 to 55-year age group only.Regarding safety, no serious adverse events were reported. More than half of the participants reported fatigue, headache, chills, myalgia or pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common following the second vaccination and in those who received the highest vaccine dose. Data on side effects and immune responses at various vaccine dosages informed the doses used or planned for use in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the investigational vaccine.The interim analysis includes results of tests measuring levels of vaccine-induced neutralizing activity through day 43 after the second injection. Two doses of vaccine prompted high levels of neutralizing antibody activity that were above the average values seen in convalescent sera obtained from persons with confirmed COVID-19 disease.A Phase 2 clinical trial of mRNA-1273, sponsored by Moderna,  began enrollment in late May. Plans are underway to launch a Phase 3 efficacy trial in July 2020. Additional information about the Phase 1 clinical trial design is available at clinicaltrials.gov using the identifier NCT04283461.

The virus uses one part of the spike protein to attach to a cell and another to fuse with the cell membrane, enabling the virus to infect the cell. The scientists studied antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, which could help inform vaccine design by increasing our understanding of the various triggered antibody responses.As of mid-June, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than eight million cases of infection and approximately 450,000 deaths globally, making the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent this disease a priority. The spike glycoprotein is the key target for protective antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) and the related SARS-CoV-1 virus. Therefore, many vaccine candidates that trigger antibodies — against specific areas on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein — are being investigated. To help build sufficient scientific knowledge about the quality of antibody responses, the FDA scientists exposed rabbits to the virus and evaluated antibody responses triggered by various SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens that are similar to those being used to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19.Today, FDA released a blueprint for implementing the New Era of Smarter Food Safety, an FDA initiative that represents a new approach to food safety, leveraging technology and other tools to create a more digital, more traceable, and safer food system. The blueprint outlines how FDA plans to usher in this new era. Together with the Food Safety Modernization Act, the blueprint moves the nation’s food production closer to achieving an Integrated Food Safety System. Among other factors included in the blueprint implementation are: (1) Tech-enabled traceability to facilitate tracking events and sharing key data across regulatory agencies, industry and other public health partners to avoid duplication of effort and complexity; (2) Smarter tools and methods to prevent and respond to food-borne illness outbreaks through evidence-based improvements in and/or implementation of root-cause analyses, artificial intelligence and machine learning applications for screening imported foods, mutual reliance with FDA’s state inspections partners, enhanced outbreak responsiveness, and modernization of product recalls; (3) New business models and retail modernization involving FDA’s strategic partners in adapting the regulatory framework to new and innovative business models. FDA will also promote facility and equipment design that support preventive controls for retail food safety management (e.g., the development and use of commercial Smart Kitchen Equipment).The FDA has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to:electroCore, Inc., for its GammaCore Sapphire Non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulator. This stimulator is intended for use at home or in health care settings to treat adult patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who are experiencing worsened asthma-related shortness of breath and reduced airflow, and for whom approved drug therapies are not tolerated or provide insufficient symptom relief as assessed by the patient’s healthcare provider. The device improves airflow and provides relief from exacerbated asthma-related shortness of breath in such patients. The device is placed on either side of the patient’s neck for two consecutive two-minute stimulations at the onset of respiratory distress or shortness of breath for up to 24 stimulations every 24 hours.Circadiance, under the umbrella EUA for ventilators, for its SleepWeaver Prevent CPAP Mask.

The White House Guidelines for Opening Up America Again are providing FDA a roadmap for optimizing operations and new work arrangements, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) guidance is informing efforts related to workplace exposures to COVID-19 in non-healthcare settings. To arm FDA investigators with the most reliable and accurate information, the FDA developed a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. The COVID-19 Advisory Rating system (COVID-19 Advisory Level) uses real-time data to qualitatively assess the number of COVID-19 cases in a local area based on state and national data. The Advisory Level data will be made available to state partners who, under contract, conduct inspections of FDA-regulated entities on the agency’s behalf.At this time, the agency is working toward restarting on-site inspections during the week of July 20. However, resuming these inspections will depend on the data about the virus’ trajectory in a given state and locality and the rules and guidelines established by those state and local governments.The agency issued new Emergency Use Authorizations for diagnostic tests developed by:The University of California-San Francisco’s Health Clinical Laboratories-UCSF Clinical Labs at China Basin (for its molecular-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA DETECTR Assay) andBioSewoom, Inc.

The company, Ionogen, LLC, offers “Ionopure Skin & Hands” for sale in the United States with misleading claims that the products can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. There are currently no FDA-approved products to prevent or treat COVID-19. Consumers concerned about COVID-19 should consult with their health care provider.Today, federal prosecutors in Miami charged four Florida residents who allegedly marketed “Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS),” a toxic bleach, as a cure for COVID-19, with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and criminal contempt. In prior warning statements, the FDA has strongly urged consumers not to purchase or use MMS, explaining that drinking MMS is the same as drinking bleach and can cause dangerous side effects, including severe vomiting, diarrhea, and life-threatening low-blood pressure. As alleged in the criminal complaint, the defendants sold this dangerous product under the guise of Genesis II Church of Health and Healing (“Genesis”), an entity they allegedly created in an attempt to avoid government regulation of MMS. The FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations conducted this investigation, with assistance from the Office of Chief Counsel.“The Genesis II Church of Health and Healing has actively and deliberately placed consumers at risk with their fraudulent Miracle Mineral Solution and Americans expect and deserve medical treatments that have been scientifically proven to be safe and effective,” said Catherine Hermsen, Assistant Commissioner of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations. “We commend the efforts of our law enforcement partners for vigorously investigating this matter. The FDA will continue our efforts to make sure these and other like-minded sellers do not jeopardize the health of Americans during this pandemic and in the future.”FDA is alerting consumers and health care professionals that additional hand sanitizer products have been added to the agency’s list of products with confirmed and potential methanol contamination. Consumers should check their hand sanitizer products to determine if a product is on this list. Methanol is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizer products and can be toxic when absorbed through the skin as well as life-threatening when ingested. FDA is aware of reports of adverse events associated with hand sanitizer products, including those contaminated with methanol. FDA encourages health care professionals, consumers, and patients to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of hand sanitizers to FDA’s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program. (When reporting such events, please provide the agency with as much information as possible to identify the product).Testing updates:To date, the FDA has currently authorized 169 tests under EUAs; these include 141 molecular tests, 26 antibody tests, and 2 antigen tests.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

In addition, the guidance includes a new question-and-answer regarding how to obtain informed consent from a prospective trial participant in certain circumstances where the enrollment timeframe is limited and the patient can receive a copy of an informed consent document electronically but cannot sign it electronically or print it out for signature. The guidance also clarifies recommendations on documenting details when using video conferencing for trial visits.The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the third diagnostic test for detection and differentiation of the viruses that cause flu and COVID-19 in individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The FDA has previously issued EUAs to BioFire Diagnostics, LLC and QIAGEN GmbH for their tests, which include many other respiratory organisms in addition to the viruses that cause flu and COVID-19. These combination tests work by testing a single sample from a patient for multiple respiratory diseases. Tests based on taking just one sample from a patient may help alleviate the need for multiple sample collections, which means less discomfort for the patient with faster and more comprehensive results. The FDA encourages additional developers to work with the FDA on combination tests that may be useful in preserving critical testing resources during the upcoming flu season.On July 2, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the second Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a COVID-19 antigen test. An antigen test is a diagnostic test that quickly detects fragments of proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the patient’s nasal cavity using swabs. The EUA was issued to Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) for the BD Veritor System For Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests can provide results in minutes, be produced at a lower cost than molecular tests, and potentially scale to test millions of Americans per day once multiple manufacturers enter the market. However, antigen tests may not detect all active infections, as they do not work the same way as a PCR test. The FDA will continue to support the development, review, and monitoring of tests to help ensure accuracy while balancing the urgent need for these critical diagnostics.Testing updates:To date, the FDA has currently authorized 164 tests under EUAs; these include 137 molecular tests, 25 antibody tests, and 2 antigen tests.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.
